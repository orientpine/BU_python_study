0,Do Adults with Stroke have Altered Interhemispheric Inhibition? A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis.,"Objective:Interhemispheric inhibition is an important cortical mechanism to support motor control. Altered interhemispheric inhibition has been the target of neuromodulation interventions. This systematic review investigated the evidence for altered interhemispheric inhibition in adults with unilateral neurological conditions: stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebral palsy, complex regional pain syndrome, traumatic brain injury, and cerebral palsy METHODS: We pre-registered the protocol and followed PRISMA guidelines. Five databases were systematically searched to identify studies reporting interhemispheric inhibition measures in unilateral neurological conditions and healthy controls. Data were grouped according to the measure (ipsilateral silent period and dual-coil), stimulated hemisphere, and stage of the condition (subacute and chronic).Results:1372 studies were identified, of which 14 were included (n = 226 adults with stroke and 161 age-matched controls). Ipsilateral silent period-duration was longer in people with stroke than in controls (stimulation of dominant hemisphere) regardless of stroke stage. Motor evoked potential was less suppressed in people with sub-acute stroke (stimulation of the unaffected hemisphere) than controls (stimulation of dominant hemisphere) and this reversed in chronic stroke.Conclusion:Detection of altered interhemispheric inhibition appears to be dependent on the measure of interhemispheric inhibition and the stage of recovery.Significance:Rebalancing interhemispheric inhibition using neuromodulation is considered a promising line of treatment for stroke rehabilitation. Our results did not find compelling evidence to support consistent alterations in interhemispheric inhibition in adults with stroke.Keywords:Interhemispheric inhibition; Ipsilateral silent period; Neurological conditions; Primary motor cortex; Transcallosal inhibition.

1,Non-invasive Brain Stimulation for Chronic Pain: State of the Art and Future Directions.,"As a technique that can guide brain plasticity, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has the potential to improve the treatment of chronic pain (CP) because it can interfere with ongoing brain neural activity to regulate specific neural networks related to pain management. Treatments of CP with various forms of NIBS, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), using new parameters of stimulation have achieved encouraging results. Evidence of moderate quality indicates that high-frequency rTMS of the primary motor cortex has a clear effect on neuropathic pain (NP) and fibromyalgia. However, evidence on its effectiveness regarding pain relief in other CP conditions is conflicting. Concerning tDCS, evidence of low quality supports its benefit for CP treatment. However, evidence suggesting that it exerts a small treatment effect on NP and headaches is also conflicting. In this paper, we describe the underlying principles behind these commonly used stimulation techniques; and summarize the results of randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Future research should focus on a better evaluation of the short-term and long-term effectiveness of all NIBS techniques and whether they decrease healthcare use, as well as on the refinement of selection criteria.Keywords:chronic pain; neuromodulation; non-invasive brain stimulation; rTMS; tDCS.

2,Physical therapy in children with cerebral palsy in Brazil: a scoping review.,"Aim:To identify and assess published studies concerning physical therapy in Brazilian children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework.Method:Articles in English and Portuguese published until October 2020, with no date restrictions, were searched in several different databases. Study characteristics, journal metrics, sample characteristics, and ICF domains explored intervention components and outcomes were extracted. Studies were classified according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine hierarchy levels to characterize the evidence.Results:Ninety-four studies were included. Spastic CP with fewer limitations in gross motor abilities was the most reported; 67% of the studies had low levels of evidence and were published in journals without an impact factor. The three most frequent interventions were neurodevelopmental treatment, suit therapy, and transcranial direct current stimulation. Intervention components explored body functions and structures (73.4%), activity (59.6%), environment (2.1%). They did not explore participation (0%). The outcomes investigated addressed activity (79.8%), body functions and structures (67.0%), and participation (1.1%), but not environment (0%).Interpretation:Studies of physical therapy for Brazilian children and adolescents with CP focused on reducing impairments and activity limitations. Studies with higher levels of evidence and an expanded focus on participation and environmental factors are necessary."
3,Exploring Clinical and Neurophysiological Factors Associated with Response to Constraint Therapy and Brain Stimulation in Children with Hemiparetic Cerebral Palsy.,"Background:Perinatal stroke causes hemiparetic cerebral palsy (HCP) and lifelong disability. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and neurostimulation may enhance motor function, but the individual factors associated with responsiveness are undetermined.Objective:We explored the clinical and neurophysiological factors associated with responsiveness to CIMT and/or brain stimulation within a clinical trial.Methods:PLASTIC CHAMPS was a randomized, blinded, sham-controlled trial (n = 45) of CIMT and neurostimulation paired with intensive, goal-directed therapy. Primary outcome was the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA). Classification trees created through recursive partitioning suggested clinical and neurophysiological profiles associated with improvement at 6-months.Results:Both clinical (stroke side (left) and age >14 years) and neurophysiological (intracortical inhibition/facilitation and motor threshold) were associated with responsiveness across treatment groups with positive predictive values (PPV) approaching 80%.Conclusion:This preliminary analysis suggested sets of variables that may be associated with response to intensive therapies in HCP. Further modeling in larger trials is required.Keywords:Perinatal stroke; constraint-induced movement therapy; hemiparetic cerebral palsy; personalized rehabilitation; transcranial magnetic stimulation.

4,Robotic mapping of motor cortex in children with perinatal stroke and hemiparesis.,"Brain stimulation combined with intensive therapy may improve hand function in children with perinatal stroke-induced unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP). However, response to therapy varies and underlying neuroplasticity mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we aimed to characterize robotic motor mapping outcomes in children with UCP. Twenty-nine children with perinatal stroke and UCP (median age 11 ± 2 years) were compared to 24 typically developing controls (TDC). Robotic, neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation was employed to define bilateral motor maps including area, volume, and peak motor evoked potential (MEP). Map outcomes were compared to the primary clinical outcome of the Jebsen-Taylor Test of Hand Function (JTT). Maps were reliably obtained in the contralesional motor cortex (24/29) but challenging in the lesioned hemisphere (5/29). Within the contralesional M1 of participants with UCP, area and peak MEP amplitude of the unaffected map were larger than the affected map. When comparing bilateral maps within the contralesional M1 in children with UCP to that of TDC, only peak MEP amplitudes were different, being smaller for the affected hand as compared to TDC. We observed correlations between the unaffected map when stimulating the contralesional M1 and function of the unaffected hand. Robotic motor mapping can characterize motor cortex neurophysiology in children with perinatal stroke. Map area and peak MEP amplitude may represent discrete biomarkers of developmental plasticity in the contralesional M1. Correlations between map metrics and hand function suggest clinical relevance and utility in studies of interventional plasticity.Keywords:cerebral palsy; motor mapping; perinatal stroke; plasticity; robotic TMS; transcranial magnetic stimulation.

5,The Effect of Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy Combined With Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Hand Function in Preschool Children With Unilateral Cerebral Palsy: A Randomized Controlled Preliminary Study.,"Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) combined with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have shown great potential in improving function in schoolchildren with unilateral cerebral palsy attributed to perinatal stroke. However, the prospect of application in preschool children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP) attributed to various brain disorders remains unclear. In this prospective, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled study, 40 preschool children with UCP (aged 2.5-6 years) were randomized to receive 10 days of CIMT combined with active or sham rTMS. Assessments were performed at baseline, 2 weeks, and 6 months post-intervention to investigate upper limb extremity, social life ability, and perceived changes by parents and motor-evoked potentials. Overall, 35 participants completed the trial. The CIMT plus active stimulation group had greater gains in the affected hand function (range of motion, accuracy, and fluency) than the CIMT plus sham stimulation group (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in muscular tone, social life ability, and perceived changes by parents between the two groups (P > 0.05). In addition, there was no significant difference in hand function between children with and without motor-evoked potential (P > 0.05). No participants reported severe adverse events during the study session. In short, the treatment of CIMT combined with rTMS is safe and feasible for preschool children with UCP attributed to various brain disorders. Randomized controlled studies with large samples and long-term effects are warranted.Keywords:constraint-induced movement therapy; hand function; preschool children; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; unilateral cerebral palsy.

6,Study Protocol: Multimodal Longitudinal Assessment of Infant Brain Organization and Recovery in Perinatal Brain Injury.,"Purpose:Perinatal brain injury is a primary cause of cerebral palsy, a condition resulting in lifelong motor impairment. Infancy is an important period of motor system development, including development of the corticospinal tract (CST), the primary pathway for cortical movement control. The interaction between perinatal stroke recovery, CST organization, and resultant motor outcome in infants is not well understood.Methods:Here, we present a protocol for multimodal longitudinal assessment of brain development and motor function following perinatal brain injury using transcranial magnetic stimulation and magnetic resonance imaging to noninvasively measure CST functional and structural integrity across multiple time points in infants 3 to 24 months of age. We will further assess the association between cortical excitability, integrity, and motor function.Discussion:This protocol will identify bioindicators of motor outcome and neuroplasticity and subsequently inform early detection, diagnosis, and intervention strategies for infants with perinatal stroke, brain bleeds, and related diagnoses."
7,Discernible effects of tDCS over the primary motor and posterior parietal cortex on different stages of motor learning.,"Implicit motor learning and memory involve complex cortical and subcortical networks. The induction of plasticity in these network components via non-invasive brain stimulation, including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has shown to improve motor learning. However, studies showing these effects are mostly restricted to stimulation of the primary motor cortex (M1) during the early stage of learning. Because of this, we aimed to explore the efficacy of anodal tDCS applied over the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which is involved in memory processes, on serial reaction time task (SRTT) performance. Specifically, to evaluate the involvement of both motor learning network components, we compared the effects of tDCS applied over regions corresponding to M1 and PPC during the early and late stages of learning. The results revealed a selective improvement of reaction time (RT) during anodal stimulation over the PPC in the late stage of learning. These findings support the assumption that the PPC is relevant during specific phases of learning, at least for SRTT performance. The results also indicate that not only the target area (i.e., PPC), but also timing is crucial for achieving the effects of stimulation on motor learning.Keywords:Motor learning; Posterior parietal cortex; Primary motor cortex; Serial reaction time task; Transcranial direct current stimulation.

8,HABIT+tDCS: a study protocol of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating the synergistic efficacy of hand-arm bimanual intensive therapy (HABIT) plus targeted non-invasive brain stimulation to improve upper extremity function in school-age children with unilateral cerebral palsy.,"Introduction:Unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (USCP) is characterised by movement deficits primarily on one body side. The best available upper extremity (UE) therapies are costly and intensive. Thus, there is an urgent need for better, more efficient and thus more accessible therapies. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is non-invasive and may enhance physical rehabilitation approaches. The aim of this study is to determine whether tDCS targeted to the hemisphere with corticospinal tract (CST) connectivity enhances the efficacy of UE training in children with USCP. Our central hypothesis is that hand-arm bimanual intensive therapy (HABIT) combined with a tDCS montage targeting the hemisphere with CST connectivity to the impaired UE muscles will improve UE function more than HABIT plus sham stimulation. We will test this by conducting a randomised clinical trial with clinical and motor cortex physiology outcomes.Methods and analyses:81 children, aged 6-17 years, will be randomised to receive 2 mA anodal tDCS targeted to the affected UE motor map, 2 mA cathodal tDCS to the contralesional motor cortex or sham tDCS during the first 20 min of each HABIT session (10 hours: 2 hours/day for 5 days). Primary outcomes will be Box and Blocks Test, Assisting Hand Assessment and motor cortex excitability, determined with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. Secondary outcomes include ABILHAND-Kids, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, Cooper Stereognosis, Dimension of Mastery Questionnaire and Participation and Environment Measure-Children and Youth. All measures will be collected before, immediately and 6 months after treatment. A group × test session Analysis of Variance will test differences among groups on all measures.Ethics and dissemination:The study has been approved by the BRANY Institutional Review Board (#18-10-285-512). We will leverage our subject and family relationships to maximise dissemination and share results with the academic and patient/family advocacy groups.Trial registration number:
NCT03402854.Keywords:neurology; neurophysiology; paediatric neurology.

9,A transcranial magnetic stimulation study for the characterization of corticospinal pathway plasticity in children with neurological disorders.,"We aimed to investigate cortical and radicular TMS-evoked motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in children with neurological disorders (n = 57, mean age: 5.45 years) and agematched healthy controls (n = 46). Four TMS parameters were analyzed: MEP amplitudes, the latencies of MEP, the latency jump (cortical MEP latency at rest - cortical active-MEP latency at with slightly contracted targeted muscle), and central motor conduction time. Children with neurological disorders were categorized according to the two major types of neuronal plasticity; excessive plasticity: 29 children with cerebral palsy and impaired plasticity: 28 children with neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, and central nervous system infections. The active-MEP abnormalities (absent and prolonged latencies) were correlated with the location of cortical involvement on MRI patterns. We obtained a significantly increased rate of abnormal cortical active-MEPs in children with impaired plasticity (21/28, 75%) compared with excessive plasticity (18/29, 62%). The rate of absent MEP response is three times more in children with impaired plasticity (43%) than in children with excessive plasticity (14%). A more reduced latency jump was measured in children with impaired plasticity compared to children with excessive plasticity. TMS-evoked active-MEPs and latency jumping are valuable parameters for characterizing neuronal plasticity in children with neurological disorders.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodegenerative disorders; Neurological syndrome; Plasticity; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

10,Spinal and corticospinal excitability in response to reductions in skin and core temperatures via whole-body cooling.,"Cold stress impairs fine and gross motor movements. Although peripheral effects of muscle cooling on performance are well understood, less is known about central mechanisms. This study characterized corticospinal and spinal excitability during surface cooling, reducing skin (Tsk) and esophageal (Tes) temperatures. Ten subjects (3 females) wore a liquid-perfused suit and were cooled (9 °C perfusate, 90 min) and rewarmed (41 °C perfusate, 30 min). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (eliciting motor evoked potentials [MEPs]), as well as transmastoid (eliciting cervicomedullary evoked potentials [CMEPs]) and brachial plexus (eliciting maximal compound motor action potentials [Mmax]) electrical stimulation, were applied at baseline, every 20 min during cooling, and following rewarming. Sixty minutes of cooling reduced Tsk by 9.6 °C (P < 0.001), but Tes remained unchanged (P = 0.92). Tes then decreased by ∼0.6 °C in the next 30 min of cooling (P < 0.001). Eight subjects shivered. During rewarming, shivering was abolished, and Tsk returned to baseline, while Tes did not increase. During cooling and rewarming, Mmax, MEP, and MEP/Mmax remained unchanged from baseline. However, CMEP and CMEP/Mmax increased during cooling by ∼85% and 79% (P < 0.001), respectively, and remained elevated post-rewarming. The results suggest that spinal excitability is facilitated by reduced Tsk during cooling and reduced Tes during warming, while corticospinal excitability remains unchanged. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04253730. Novelty: This is the first study to characterize corticospinal and spinal excitability during whole-body cooling and rewarming in humans. Whole body cooling did not affect corticospinal excitability. Spinal excitability was facilitated during reductions in both skin and core temperatures.Keywords:cold performance; performance au froid; stimulation magnétique transcrânienne; thermoregulation; thermorégulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation.

11,"The Effect of Bilateral Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation versus Treadmill Training on Brain Activities, Gait Functions, Level of Participation and Enjoyment of Children with Cerebral Palsy: A Randomized Controlled Trial Protocol.","Background:Cerebral palsy (CP) possesses bilateral sensory-motor cortical excitability alterations. In past studies, researchers have applied unilateral anodal transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) with inconsistent findings.Objective:Examining the effects of treadmill training with either unilateral or bilateral anodal tDCS stimulation on brain activities, gait, and body functions of children with CP.Design:Randomized-clinical-trial.Participants:Eighty children with CP will be allocated into: treadmill/bilateral-tDCS, treadmill/unilateral-tDCS, treadmill/sham-tDCS, and treadmill groups. Additional 20 neurotypical children will be recruited for comparison.Intervention:Planned intervention will implement ten-sessions of treadmill training (50% of maximum-ground speed) either with unilateral-tDCS over left sensory-motor, or bilateral-tDCS over left/right sensory-motor areas. Brain activities, gait, body functions, and participation will be assessed at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at one-month follow-up.Result and discussion:This study would contribute to extant findings on the use of tDCS stimulation in children with CP and to our understanding of the appropriateness of the planned outcome measures.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; balance; brain activity; gait functions; quality of life; transcranial direct current stimulation.

12,Neuromodulation: A combined-therapy protocol for speech rehabilitation in a child with cerebral palsy.,"Introduction:Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates cortical activity and potentiates functional gains achieved during therapeutic protocols. The aim of Integrative Speech Therapy Protocol is to rehabilitate speech in patients with impairments regarding neuropyschomotor development by combining oral motor stimuli, specific articulatory production, and the stimulation of phonological aspects of language.Objective:Investigate the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation combined to integrative speech therapy in a child with cerebral palsy.Methods:We performed a case study with tDCS and speech therapy in a patient with cerebral palsy and apraxia of speech. To assess the patient's speech, we used a parameterized test for the Brazilian Portuguese speech - ABFW. The CFCS and Vicking Speech Scales presented level IV and III, respectively. The patient underwent two periods with ten stimulation sessions each: first with anodal stimulation over Broca's area; and second over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Two indices were calculated: the percentage of consonants correct; and percentage of consonants correct-revised. Descriptive statistics were employed for the clinical data. For the outcomes, changes in each score were calculated as the difference in pre-intervention and post-intervention using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.Results:Increases were found in percentage of correct consonants indices as well as to produce two-syllable and three-syllable words after both types of stimulation, characterized mainly by correct vowels that marked the presence of the syllable. Number of phonemes increased 0 to 4 at first the stimulation and 4 to 10 at the second.Conclusion:The combined-therapy program contributed to improve the speech rehabilitation results in a patient with cerebral palsy."
13,The Effects of tDCS with NDT on the Improvement of Motor Development in Cerebral Palsy.,"We investigated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) with neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT) on the improvement of motor development and reduction of spasticity in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Twenty-four children with CP were allocated to two groups: the tDCS + NDT group and the only NDT group, done 3 times per week for 5 weeks. The Gross Motor Function Measurement (GMFM-88) and Box and Block Test (BBT) were used to assess changes in motor development, and the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) was used to evaluate changes in spasticity. All measurements were carried out at 3 time points: baseline, post-intervention, and 1 month follow-up. We found improvements in the GMFM-88 total scores and in each individual GMFM-88 dimension scores, favoring the tDCS + NDT group over the only NDT group. The BBT scores improved only in the tDCS + NDT group. In addition, the MAS scores reduced in the hemibody with significant motor impairment only in the tDCS + NDT group. The present findings suggest that tDCS combined with NDT can be considered a promising intervention for children with CP, as it can enhance motor development and reduce spasticity in this population.Keywords:cerebral palsy; gross motor function; motor development; neurodevelopmental training; transcranial direct current stimulation.

14,Evaluating the Effects of 5-Hz Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation With and Without Wrist-Ankle Acupuncture on Improving Spasticity and Motor Function in Children With Cerebral Palsy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"
Objective: The goal of this study is to explore the effect of wrist-ankle acupuncture combined with 5-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on improving spastic state and motor function of children with spastic cerebral palsy by measuring electrophysiological parameters and behaviors. Methods: Twenty-five children with spastic cerebral palsy were enrolled in a single-blind and randomized controlled trial. The control group received 20 sessions of 5-Hz rTMS over the affected hemisphere with 1,000 pulses. The experimental group was given wrist-ankle acupuncture on the basis of the control group. Gross motor function measure (GMFM-66), muscle tension, and electrophysiological parameters of the two groups were assessed at baseline and after intervention. Results: After treatment, the GMFM-66 scores in the same groups were significantly improved (p < 0.001). Besides, the R-value of soleus, gastrocnemius, and hamstring muscle decreased (p < 0.05), and the results showed a trend of shortening MEP latency, increasing amplitude and duration (p < 0.05). Compared to the controlled group, the experimental group displayed more excellent changes in the GMFM-66 scores and motor evoked potential (MEP) latency. The statistical results showed that the increase of GMFM-66 score and the shortening of MEP latency in the experimental group were greater than that in the control group (p < 0.05). However, no significant differences were found in the assessment of muscle tension, amplitude, and duration of MEPs between two groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Wrist-ankle acupuncture combined with 5-Hz rTMS is optimal to improve gross motor function and enhance the conductivity of corticospinal tract in children with cerebral palsy but cannot highlight its clinical superiority in improving spasticity.

15,Combined effect of hydrotherapy and transcranial direct-current stimulation on children with cerebral palsy: A protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Background:Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a brain injury resulting in poor coordination and motor control deficits, which is one of the most common physical disabilities in children. CP brings a heavy burden on families and society and becomes a significant public health issue. In recent years, hydrotherapy, and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as a physical therapy for CP is developing rapidly. When hydrotherapy and tDCS are used to treat separately, it has positive therapeutic effect in children with CP. The development of new therapies in combination with physical rehabilitation approaches is critical to optimize functional outcomes. tDCS has attracted interest in this context, because of significant functional improvements have been demonstrated in individuals with brain injuries after a short period of cerebral stimulation. Since the onset of this work, tDCS has been used in combination with constraint-induced therapy, virtual reality therapy to potentiate the treatment effect. Up to now, there are no studies on the effect of a combined application of hydrotherapy and tDCS in children with CP. We will conduct a 2-arm parallel clinical trial to investigate the effect of a combined application of tDCS and hydrotherapy.Methods and analysis:This study is an outcome assessor and data analyst-blinded, randomized, controlled superiority trial during the period from October 2021 to December 2023. CP patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio into the treatment group (hydrotherapy plus tDCS), or the control group (treatment as usual). All participants will receive 30 sessions of treatment over 10 weeks. The primary outcomes will be the difference in the Gross Motor Function Assessment and Pediatric Balance Scale during rest and activity. The secondary outcomes will be the difference in adverse effects between the control and treatment groups.Conclusions:This study aims to estimate the efficacy of a combined application of tDCS and hydrotherapy in patients with CP.Trial registration:This study protocol was registered in Chinese ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: ChiCTR2100047946."

17,Brain functional reorganization in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy: Assessment with TMS and therapeutic perspectives.,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be a useful tool for the assessment of the brain functional reorganization in subjects with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP). In this review, we performed a systematic search of all studies using TMS in order to explore the neuroplastic changes that occur in HCP patients. We aimed at investigating the usefulness of TMS to explore cortical excitability, plasticity and connectivity changes in HCP. Children with HCP due to unilateral lesions of the corticospinal system had ipsilateral motor evoked potentials (MEPs) similar to those recorded contralaterally. TMS studies demonstrated that occupational and constraint-induced movement therapy were associated with significant improvements in contralateral and ipsilateral corticomotor projection patterns. In addition, after intensive bimanual therapy, children with HCP showed increased activation and size of the motor areas controlling the affected hand. A TMS mapping study revealed a mediolateral location of the upper and lower extremity map motor cortical representations. Deficits in intracortical and interhemispheric inhibitory mechanisms were observed in HCP. Early hand function impairment correlated with the extension of brain damage, number of involved areas, and radiological signs of corticospinal tract (CST) degeneration. Clinical mirror movements (MMs) correlated with disability and CST organization in subjects with HCP and a positive relationship was found between MMs and MEPs strength. Therefore, TMS studies have shed light on important pathophysiological aspects of motor cortex and CST reorganization in HCP patients. Furthermore, repetitive TMS (rTMS) might have therapeutic effects on CST activities, functional connectivity and clinical status in children with HCP.Keywords:Corticospinal tract; Hemiplegic cerebral palsy; Mirror movements; Motor evoked potentials; Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

18,Measurement error and reliability of TMS metrics collected from biceps and triceps in individuals with chronic incomplete tetraplegia.,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is used to investigate corticomotor neurophysiology associated with functional recovery in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). There is insufficient evidence about test-retest measurement properties of TMS in SCI. Therefore, we investigated test-retest agreement and reliability of TMS metrics representing corticomotor excitability, output, gain, map (representation), and inhibition in individuals with cervical SCI. We collected TMS metrics from biceps and triceps muscles because of the relevance of this proximal muscle pair to the cervical SCI population. Twelve individuals with chronic C3-C6 SCI participated in two TMS sessions separated by ≥ 2 weeks. Measurement agreement was evaluated using t tests, Bland-Altman limits of agreement and relative standard error of measurement (SEM%), while reliability was investigated using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). We calculated the smallest detectable change for all TMS metrics. All TMS metrics except antero-posterior map coordinates and corticomotor inhibition were in agreement upon repeated measurement though limits of agreement were generally large. Measures of corticomotor excitability, output and medio-lateral map coordinates had superior agreement (SEM% < 10). Metrics representing corticomotor excitability, output, and inhibition had good-to-excellent reliability (ICC/CCC > 0.75). The smallest detectable change for TMS metrics was generally high for a single individual, but this value reduced substantially with increase in sample size. We recommend use of corticomotor excitability and recruitment curve area owing to their superior measurement properties. A modest group size (20 or above) yields more stable measurements, which may favor use of TMS metrics in group level modulation after SCI.Keywords:Measurement error; Reliability; Smallest detectable change; Spinal cord injury; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

19,"Treatment of major depressive disorder with bilateral theta burst stimulation: study protocol for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial (TBS-D).","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is currently evolving as an effective and safe therapeutic tool in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, already established rTMS treatment paradigms are rather time-consuming. With theta burst stimulation (TBS), a patterned form of rTMS, treatment time can be substantially reduced. Pilot studies and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrate non-inferiority of TBS to 10 Hz rTMS and support a wider use in MDD. Still, data from placebo-controlled multicenter RCTs are lacking. In this placebo-controlled multicenter study, 236 patients with MDD will be randomized to either intermittent TBS (iTBS) to the left and continuous TBS (cTBS) to the right dlPFC or bilateral sham stimulation (1:1 ratio). The treatment will be performed with 80% resting motor threshold intensity over six consecutive weeks (30 sessions). The primary outcome is the treatment response rate (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale reduction ≥ 50%). The aim of the study is to confirm the superiority of active bilateral TBS compared to placebo treatment. In two satellite studies, we intend to identify possible MRI-based and (epi-)genetic predictors of responsiveness to TBS therapy. Positive results will support the clinical use of bilateral TBS as an advantageous, efficient, and well-tolerated treatment and pave the way for further individualization of MDD therapy.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04392947).Keywords:Brain stimulation; Major depression; Multicenter; Randomized controlled trial; Theta burst stimulation; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

20,Contribution of altered corticospinal microstructure to gait impairment in children with cerebral palsy.,"Objective:Corticospinal tract (CST) injury may lead to motor disorders in children with Cerebral Palsy (CP). However, the precise underlying mechanisms are still ambiguous. We aimed to characterize the CST structure and function in children with CP and determine their contributions to balance and gait impairments.Method:Twenty-six children with spastic CP participated. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were utilized to characterize CST structure and function. Common clinical measures were used to assess gait speed, endurance and balance, and mobility.Results:CST structure and function were significantly altered in children with CP. Different abnormal patterns of CST structure were identified as either abnormal appearance of brain hemispheres (Group-1) or semi-normal CST appearance (Group-2). We found significant correlations between the DTI parameters of the more affected CST and gait features only in Group-1.Conclusion:CST structure and function are abnormal in children with CP and these abnormalities may contribute to balance and gait impairment in some children with CP.Significance:Our findings may lead to the development of further investigations on the mechanisms underlying gait impairment in children with CP and on decision-making for more effective rehabilitation.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; Corticospinal tract; Diffusion tensor imaging; Gait impairment; Lower extremity; Spasticity; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

21,"Effect of Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Combined With Cognitive Training for Improving Cognition and Language Among Children With Cerebral Palsy With Cognitive Impairment: A Pilot, Randomized, Controlled, Double-Blind, and Clinical Trial.","About 30-45% of cerebral palsy (CP) patients have cognitive impairment. Previous studies showed the evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may have some benefits in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and motor development in CP. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of tDCS on cognition, language, and activities of daily living (ADL) among children with CP with cognitive impairment. It was a pilot, randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial in a tertiary pediatric hospital, and 13 children with CP and a cognitive age under 42 months were enrolled. tDCS group (n = 8) had active tDCS and cognitive training (20 min/session, total 20 sessions, for 12 weeks) and sham group (n = 5) had sham tDCS and cognitive training. Primary outcome was the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSID II). Secondary outcomes were the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI), the Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery (Lab-TAB), the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire (ECBQ), the Korean version of MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (M-B CDI-K), the Sequenced Language Scale for Infants (SELSI) and the Preschool Receptive-Expressive Language Scale (PRES). After intervention, the tDCS group showed significant improvements in all measurements (p < 0.05) except the M-B CDI-K (grammar), whereas the sham group only showed significant improvements in the Lab-TAB (manipulation domain), the ECBQ (attentional shifting), and the M-B CDI-K (comprehension). The between-group differences in the degree of post-intervention improvement were not statistically significant. The degree of improvement was associated with better baseline cognitive function and younger age (p < 0.05). There were no major adverse events after tDCS. The combined application of tDCS and cognitive training was feasible and associated with improvements in cognitive function, ADL, and language among children with CP with cognitive impairment. However, considering that it is a pilot study, further larger-scale systematic investigation is needed.

22,TMS-Induced Central Motor Conduction Time at the Non-Infarcted Hemisphere Is Associated with Spontaneous Motor Recovery of the Paretic Upper Limb after Severe Stroke.,"Background:Stroke affects the neuronal networks of the non-infarcted hemisphere. The central motor conduction time (CMCT) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) could be used to determine the conduction time of the corticospinal tract of the non-infarcted hemisphere after a stroke.Objectives:Our primary aim was to demonstrate the existence of prolonged CMCT in the non-infarcted hemisphere, measured within the first 48 h when compared to normative data, and secondly, if the severity of motor impairment of the affected upper limb was significantly associated with prolonged CMCTs in the non-infarcted hemisphere when measured within the first 2 weeks post stroke.Methods:CMCT in the non-infarcted hemisphere was measured in 50 patients within 48 h and at 11 days after a first-ever ischemic stroke. Patients lacking significant spontaneous motor recovery, so-called non-recoverers, were defined as those who started below 18 points on the FM-UE and showed less than 6 points (10%) improvement within 6 months.Results:CMCT in the non-infarcted hemisphere was prolonged in 30/50 (60%) patients within 48 h and still in 24/49 (49%) patients at 11 days. Sustained prolonged CMCT in the non-infarcted hemisphere was significantly more frequent in non-recoverers following FM-UE.Conclusions:The current study suggests that CMCT in the non-infarcted hemisphere is significantly prolonged in 60% of severely affected, ischemic stroke patients when measured within the first 48 h post stroke. The likelihood of CMCT is significantly higher in non-recoverers when compared to those that show spontaneous motor recovery early post stroke.Keywords:prognosis; recovery; stroke; transcranial magnetic stimulation; upper limb.

23,Neurophysiological Assessments of Brain and Spinal Cord Associated with Lower Limb Functions in Children with Cerebral Palsy: A Protocol for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Background:Task-dependent neurophysiological adaptations in people with cerebral palsy have been examined using various techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, peripheral nerve stimulation in order to assess H-reflexes, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. This activity-dependent plasticity is hypothesized to improve specific gross motor function in individuals with cerebral palsy. Although these adaptations have been examined extensively, most studies examined tasks utilizing the upper limbs. The aim of this review is to assess the neurophysiological adaptations of the central nervous system in individuals with cerebral palsy during lower limb functional tasks.Methods:A systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted to evaluate the neurophysiological changes in the brain and spinal cord associated with lower extremity tasks in individuals with cerebral palsy. We will search within PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, and CINAHL using a predetermined search string to identify and evaluate relevant studies. Two independent reviewers will screen these studies against our inclusion criteria and risks of bias, and will extract the data from each study. A third reviewer will be used to resolve any disagreement regarding the inclusion of a study between reviewers. Randomized controlled trials as well as cross-sectional studies published in English 10 years before May 2021 that investigate the neurophysiological adaptations in the brain and spinal cord in people with cerebral palsy will be included if they meet the eligibility criteria. Primary outcomes will include scalar values of fractional anisotropy (FA), H-reflex gains or measures of amplitude, as well as motor cortex (M1) cortical excitability as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation.Discussion:Since no identifiable data will be involved in this study, no ethical approval is required. Our results will provide insight into the neurophysiological adaptations in children with cerebral palsy, which will be useful in guiding directions for clinical decision making and future development of targeted interventions in pediatrics rehabilitation for children with cerebral palsy. Systematic review registration: The protocol for this systematic review is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number: CRD42020215902).Keywords:cerebral palsy; neurophysiology; neuroplasticity; systematic review; walking.

24,Goals of children with unilateral cerebral palsy in a brain stimulation arm rehabilitation trial.,"Aim:To explore relationships between category classifications for children's rehabilitation goals, outcomes, and participant characteristics.Method:Children with hemiparetic cerebral palsy due to perinatal stroke rated self-selected goals with the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and completed the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) and Box and Block Test (BBT), at baseline and 6 months, in a randomized, controlled 10-day neuromodulation rehabilitation trial using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Goals were classified with the Canadian Model of Occupational Performance and Engagement and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Analysis included standard linear regression.Results:Data for 45 participants (mean age 11y 7mo, SD 3y 10mo, range 6-19y, 29 males, 16 females) on 186 goals were included. Self-care goal percentage corresponded with baseline BBT by age (standardized ß=-0.561, p=0.004). Leisure goal percentage corresponded with baseline BBT (standardized ß=0.419, p=0.010). AHA change corresponded with productivity goals (standardized ß=0.327, p=0.029) and age (standardized ß=0.481, p=0.002). COPM change corresponded with baseline COPM and age by AHA change (p<0.05).Interpretation:Younger children with lower motor function were more likely to select self-care goals while those with better function tended to select leisure goals. Functional improvement corresponded with older age and productivity goals. COPM change scores reflected functional improvement among older children. Children chose functionally and developmentally appropriate goals. Consequently, children should be free to set goals that matter to them.What this paper adds:Children in a brain stimulation trial chose divergent upper extremity functional goals. Younger children with lower ability chose more self-care goals. Children with higher ability chose more leisure goals. Older children's goal ratings reflected objective functional motor gains. Children chose goals appropriate to their function and level of development."
25,Protocol for a cost-utility analysis of neurostimulation and intensive camp-based therapy for children with perinatal stroke and hemiparesis based on a multicentre clinical trial.,"Introduction:Perinatal stroke leads to cerebral palsy (CP) and lifelong disability for thousands of Canadian children. Hemiparesis, referring to impaired functionality in one side of the body, is a common complication of perinatal stroke. Standard long-term care for hemiparetic CP focuses on rehabilitation therapies. Early research suggests that patients with hemiparesis may benefit from adjunctive neuromodulation treatments such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS uses electric current to stimulate targeted areas of the brain non-invasively, potentially enhancing the effects of motor learning therapies. This protocol describes an economic evaluation to be conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the incremental cost of tDCS added to a camp-based therapy compared with camp-based therapy alone per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in children with hemiparetic CP.Methods and analysis:The Stimulation for Perinatal Stroke Optimising Recovery Trajectories (SPORT) trial is a multicentre RCT evaluating tDCS added to a 2-week camp-based therapy for children aged 6-18 years with perinatal ischaemic stroke and disabling hemiparetic CP affecting the upper limb. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, 1 week, 2 months and 6 months following intervention. Cost and quality of life data are collected at baseline and 6 months and results will be used to conduct a cost-utility analysis (CUA). The evaluation will be conducted from the perspectives of the public healthcare system and society. The CUA will be conducted over a 6-month time horizon.Ethics and dissemination:Ethical approval for the SPORT trial and the associated economic evaluation has been given by the research ethics boards at each of the study sites. The findings of the economic evaluation will be submitted for publication in a peer reviewed academic journal and submitted for presentation at conference.Trial registration number:

26,Changes of Structural Brain Network Following Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Children With Bilateral Spastic Cerebral Palsy: A Diffusion Tensor Imaging Study.,"
Introduction: Bilateral spastic cerebral palsy (BSCP) is the most common subtype of cerebral palsy (CP), which is characterized by various motor and cognitive impairments, as well as emotional instability. However, the neural basis of these problems and how repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can make potential impacts on the disrupted structural brain network in BSCP remain unclear. This study was aimed to explore the topological characteristics of the structural brain network in BSCP following the treatment of rTMS. Methods: Fourteen children with BSCP underwent 4 weeks of TMS and 15 matched healthy children (HC) were enrolled. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were acquired from children with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy before treatment (CP1), children with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy following treatment (CP2) and HC. The graph theory analysis was applied to construct the structural brain network. Then nodal clustering coefficient (C i ) and shortest path length (L i ) were measured and compared among groups. Results: Brain regions with significant group differences in C i were located in the left precental gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, calcarine fissure, cuneus, lingual gyrus, postcentral gyrus, inferior parietal gyri, angular gyrus, precuneus, paracentral lobule and the right inferior frontal gyrus (triangular part), insula, posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, paracentral lobule, pallidum. In addition, significant differences were detected in the L i of the left precental gyrus, lingual gyrus, superior occipital gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, precuneus and the right median cingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, putamen, thalamus. Post hoc t-test revealed that the CP2 group exhibited increased C i in the right inferior frontal gyrus, pallidum and decreased L i in the right putamen, thalamus when compared with the CP1 group. Conclusion: Significant differences of node-level metrics were found in various brain regions of BSCP, which indicated a disruption in structural brain connectivity in BSCP. The alterations of the structural brain network provided a basis for understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of motor and cognitive impairments in BSCP. Moreover, the right inferior frontal gyrus, putamen, thalamus could potentially be biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of TMS.Keywords:cerebral palsy; diffusion tensor imaging; graph theory; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; structural brain network.

27,From adults to pediatrics: A review noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) to facilitate recovery from brain injury.,"Stroke is a major problem worldwide that impacts over 100 million adults and children annually. Rehabilitation therapy is the current standard of care to restore functional impairments post-stroke, however its effects are limited and many patients suffer persisting functional impairments and life-long disability. Noninvasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) has emerged as a potential rehabilitation treatment option in both adults and children with brain injury. In the last decade, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) have been investigated to improve motor recovery in adults post-stroke. These promising adult findings using NIBS, however, have yet to be widely translated to the area of pediatrics. The limited studies exploring NIBS in children have demonstrated safety, feasibility, and utility of stimulation-augmented rehabilitation. This chapter will describe the mechanism of NIBS therapy (cortical excitability, neuroplasticity) that underlies its use in stroke and motor function and how TMS, tDCS, and taVNS are applied in adult stroke treatment paradigms. We will then discuss the current state of NIBS in early pediatric brain injury and will provide insight regarding practical considerations and future applications of NIBS in pediatrics to make this promising treatment option a viable therapy in children.Keywords:Brain injury; Brain stimulation; Cerebral palsy; NIBS; Pediatrics; Stroke; TMS; VNS; tDCS; tVNS; taVNS.

29,Cardiovascular Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Bimanual Training in Children With Cerebral Palsy.,"Purpose:To determine the influence of combined transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the motor cortex (M1) and bimanual training on cardiovascular function in children with cerebral palsy (CP).Methods:Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and HR variability (HRV) were measured immediately before and after 20 minutes of cathodal tDCS to contralesional M1 and bimanual training on days 1, 6, and 10 of a 10-day trial in 8 participants (5 females, 7-19 years).Results:Baseline MAP and HR were similar across days (93 ± 10 mm Hg and 90 ± 10 bpm, P > .05). MAP was similar from baseline to postintervention across all 3 days. Systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, nor HR significantly changed. HRV was not influenced by the 10-day intervention.Conclusions:Combined cathodal tDCS to M1 and bimanual training does not influence autonomic and cardiovascular function in children with CP due to perinatal stroke."
30,Multimodal assessment of motor pathways and intracortical connections in functional hemispherectomy.,"Purpose:For selected children with medically intractable epilepsy, hemispherectomy can be an excellent treatment option and its efficacy in achieving seizure freedom or reduction in seizure frequency has been shown in several studies, but patients' selection could not be straightforward and often it is taken on subjective basis. We described a multimodal approach to assess patient eligible for hemispherectomy and possibly predicting post-surgical outcomes.Methods:We describe pre- and post-surgical clinical features along with neuroradiological results by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), MR-tractography (MRT), and neurophysiological study by single and paired pulses transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a child with cerebral palsy with epileptic encephalopathy, eligible for epilepsy surgery.Results:Presurgical TMS evaluation showed a lateralization of motor function on the left motor cortex for both arms, and results were confirmed by MRI studies. Interestingly, after surgery, both epilepsy and motor performances improved and TMS showed enhancement of intracortical inhibition and facilitation activity.Conclusion:Functional hemispherectomy is an effective treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy, and multimodal presurgical assessment may be a useful approach to guide surgeons in selecting patients. Moreover, pre- and post-surgical evaluation of these patients may enhance our understanding of brain plasticity phenomena.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; MR-tractography; Medically intractable epilepsy; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; fMRI.

31,Developmental Remodelling of the Motor Cortex in Hemiparetic Children With Perinatal Stroke.,"Background:Perinatal stroke often leads to lifelong motor impairment. Two common subtypes differ in timing, location, and mechanism of injury: periventricular venous infarcts (PVI) are fetal white matter lesions while most arterial ischemic strokes (AIS) are cortical injuries acquired near term birth. Both alter motor system development and primary motor cortex (M1) plasticity, often with retained ipsilateral corticospinal fibers from the non-lesioned motor cortex (M1').Methods:Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to define patterns of motor cortex activity during paretic and unaffected hand movement. Peak coordinates of M1, M1', and the supplementary motor area in the lesioned and intact hemispheres were compared to age-matched controls. Correlations between displacements and clinical motor function were explored.Results:Forty-nine participants included 14 PVI (12.59 ± 3.7 years), 13 AIS (14.91 ± 3.9 years), and 22 controls (13.91 ± 3.4 years). AIS displayed the greatest M1 displacement from controls in the lesioned hemisphere while PVI locations approximated controls. Peak M1' activations were displaced from the canonical hand knob in both PVI and AIS. Extent of M1 and M1' displacement were correlated (r = 0.50, P = 0.025) but were not associated with motor function. Supplementary motor area activity elicited by paretic tapping was displaced in AIS compared to controls (P = 0.003).Conclusion:Motor network components may be displaced in both hemispheres after perinatal stroke, particularly in AIS and those with ipsilateral control of the affected limb. Modest correlations with clinical function may support that more complex models of developmental plasticity are needed to inform targets for individualized neuromodulatory therapies in children with perinatal stroke.Keywords:Hemiparetic cerebral palsy; Motor plasticity; Perinatal stroke; Primary motor cortex.

32,tDCS and motor training in individuals with central nervous system disease: A systematic review.,"Background:Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising tool for patients with neurological disorders, as it increases cortical excitability, motor learning and functionality. The studies up to date have focused on the tDCS parameters while the effects of the motor training have not yet been fully addressed. The purpose of this study is to present a systematic review of all studies related to tDCS in conjunction with motor training (MT) to improve gait performance, functionality, mobility and balance in individuals with non-progressive central nervous system diseases.Methods:Seven databases were searched for articles from inception to October 2018. The search strategy followed Collaboration guidelines. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) Scale and Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias were applied to evaluate methodological quality.Results:Four hundred and sixteen recorded were screened. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies were randomized controlled trials, two of them had a crossover design and other two were pilot studies. Three paper analyzed children and adolescents with cerebral palsy, seven papers analyzed adults and elderly post stroke. tDCS with MT lead to significant results.Conclusions:This review found limited evidence for the use of tDCS with MT for in children with CP and adults post stroke, due to the small number of studies as well as their methodological heterogeneity. In the absence of more robust evidence, further studies with a consistent methodological design are needed to endorse the clinical application of tDCS with motor training.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; Gait; tDCS.

33,Effect of Combined Therapy of Virtual Reality and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Children and Adolescents With Cerebral Palsy: A Study Protocol for a Triple-Blinded Randomized Controlled Crossover Trial.,"
Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and therapy-based virtual reality (VR) have been investigated separately. They have shown promise as efficient and engaging new tools in the neurological rehabilitation of individuals with cerebral palsy (CP). However, the recent literature encourages investigation of the combination of therapy tools in order to potentiate clinic effects and its mechanisms. Methods: A triple-blinded randomised sham-controlled crossover trial will be performed. Thirty-six individuals with gross motor function of levels I to IV (aged 4-14 years old) will be recruited. Individuals will be randomly assigned to Group A (active first) or S (sham first): Group A will start with ten sessions of active tDSC combined with VR tasks. After a 1-month washout, this group will be reallocated to another ten sessions with sham tDCS combined with VR tasks. In contrast, Group S will carry out the opposite protocol, starting with sham tDCS. For the active tDCS the protocol will use low frequency tDCS [intensity of 1 milliampere (mA)] over the primary cortex (M1) area on the dominant side of the brain. Clinical evaluations (reaction times and coincident timing through VR, functional scales: Abilhand-Kids, ACTIVLIM-CP, Paediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-PEDI- and heart rate variability-HRV) will be performed at baseline, during, and after active and sham tDCS. Conclusion: tDCS has produced positive results in treating individuals with CP; thus, its combination with new technologies shows promise as a potential mechanism for improving neurological functioning. The results of this study may provide new insights into motor rehabilitation, thereby contributing to the better use of combined tDCS and VR in people with CP.

34,A transcranial magnetic stimulation study for the investigation of corticospinal motor pathways in children with cerebral palsy.,"The aim of this study is to perform transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-based investigation of corticospinal motor pathways in children with cerebral palsy (CP) secondary to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). TMS parameters including motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and central motor conduction time (CMCT) were recorded in 38 children with CP and 46 age-matched healthy controls. The z-score of MEPs were analyzed with respect to the types of MRI patterns of cortical involvement in children with CP. MEP latency values were correlated with the weight and height of children and to reflect the maturation of the corticospinal pathway. TMS evoked MEPs with prolonged onset latencies in 64% of children with CP while 10% of the CP group failed to elicit MEPs. Related with the MRI pattern, multicystic encephalomalacia (89%) was associated with the highest rates of abnormal cortical MEPs, as followed by periventricular leukomalacia (80%), basal ganglia involvement (66%) and focal cortical involvement (60%) patterns. Children with CP as compared with healthy controls had similar CMCT values on the upper and lower extremities in children with all cortical MR patterns. MEP abnormalities with TMS were consistent with the extent of motor cortex lesions on MRI patterns in CP children with HIE.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurological syndrome; Plasticity; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

35,Task load modulates tDCS effects on brain network for phonological processing.,"Motor participation in phonological processing can be modulated by task nature across the speech perception to speech production range. The pars opercularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) would be increasingly active across this range, because of changing motor demands. Here, we investigated with simultaneous tDCS and fMRI whether the task load modulation of tDCS effects translates into predictable patterns of functional connectivity. Findings were analysed under the ""multi-node framework"", according to which task load and the network structure underlying cognitive functions are modulators of tDCS effects. In a within-subject study, participants (N = 20) performed categorical perception, lexical decision and word naming tasks [which differentially recruit the target of stimulation (LIFG)], which were repeatedly administered in three tDCS sessions (anodal, cathodal and sham). The LIFG, left superior temporal gyrus and their right homologues formed the target network subserving phonological processing. C-tDCS inhibition and A-tDCS excitation should increase with task load. Correspondingly, the larger the task load, the larger the relevance of the target for the task and smaller the room for compensation of C-tDCS inhibition by less relevant nodes. Functional connectivity analyses were performed with partial correlations, and network compensation globally inferred by comparing the relative number of significant connections each condition induced relative to sham. Overall, simultaneous tDCS and fMRI was adequate to show that motor participation in phonological processing is modulated by task nature. Network responses induced by C-tDCS across phonological processing tasks matched predictions. A-tDCS effects were attributed to optimisation of network efficiency.Keywords:LIFG; Language; Phonological processing; Task load; fMRI; tDCS.

36,Motor learning in unilateral cerebral palsy and the influence of corticospinal tract reorganization.,"Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a complex neurological disorder, characterized by congenital motor disability associated with behaviour, perception and cognition disorders. The sensorimotor impairments represent the main hallmark of the disease, significantly impacting the quality of life. So far, few studies have investigated motor learning abilities in CP and their association with the plastic reorganization of the motor system remains largely unknown. The present proof-of-principle study explored explicit motor sequence learning in children with unilateral CP and different patterns of motor system reorganization (bilateral, ipsilateral, contralateral). Children with unilateral CP, and a group of age-matched typically developing (TD) children, underwent a sequential finger tapping task, performed with the affected hand by children with CP and with the non-dominant hand by TD children. The pattern of corticospinal tract projections in hemiparetic patients was assessed by single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Results showed the presence of finger dexterity impairments in children with unilateral CP presenting with a bilateral or an ipsilateral control of the affected (trained) hand, as compared to TD children. Conversely, motor sequence learning was impaired in unilateral CP with ipsilateral or contralateral corticospinal reorganization, but not in the case of a bilateral control of the paretic hand. These preliminary findings, although referred to small clinical samples, suggest that unilateral control of the paretic upper-limb, from the ipsilateral or the contralateral motor cortex, may not be sufficient to develop typical motor learning with the affected hand, which seems to require a bilateral representation in the motor cortex. This evidence has potential implications for fine motor skills rehabilitation in CP.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; Corticospinal tract reorganization; Dexterity; Motor cortex; Motor learning.

37,Understanding the impact of bilateral brain injury in children with unilateral cerebral palsy.,"The presence of bilateral brain injury in patients with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) may impact neuroplasticity in the ipsilateral hemisphere; however, this pattern of injury is typically under-analyzed due to the lack of methods robust to severe injury. In this study, injury-robust methods have been applied to structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of a cohort of 91 children with unilateral CP (37 with unilateral and 54 with bilateral brain injury, 4-17 years) and 44 typically developing controls (5-17 years), to determine how brain structure is associated with concurrent motor function, and if these associations differ between patients with unilateral or bilateral injury. Regression models were used to associate these measures with two clinical scores of hand function, with patient age, gender, brain injury laterality, and interaction effects included. Significant associations with brain structure and motor function were observed (Pearson's r = .494-.716), implicating several regions of the motor pathway, and demonstrating an accurate prediction of hand function from MRI, regardless of the extent of brain injury. Reduced brain volumes were observed in patients with bilateral injury, including volumes of the thalamus and corpus callosum splenium, compared to those with unilateral injury, and the healthy controls. Increases in cortical thickness in several cortical regions were observed in cohorts with unilateral and bilateral injury compared to controls, potentially suggesting neuroplasticity might be occurring in the inferior frontal gyrus and the precuneus. These findings identify prospective useful target regions for transcranial magnetic stimulation intervention.Keywords:bilateral; cerebral palsy; interventions; magnetic resonance imaging; plasticity.

38,"White matter characteristics of motor, sensory and interhemispheric tracts underlying impaired upper limb function in children with unilateral cerebral palsy.","This study explored the role of lesion timing (periventricular white matter versus cortical and deep grey matter lesions) and type of corticospinal tract (CST) wiring pattern (contralateral, bilateral, ipsilateral) on white matter characteristics of the CST, medial lemniscus, superior thalamic radiations and sensorimotor transcallosal fibers in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP), and examined the association with upper limb function. Thirty-four children (mean age 10 years 7 months ± 2 years 3 months) with unilateral CP underwent a comprehensive upper limb evaluation and diffusion weighted imaging (75 directions, b value 2800). Streamline count, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were extracted from the targeted tracts and asymmetry indices were additionally calculated. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to assess the CST wiring pattern. Results showed a more damaged CST in children with cortical and deep grey matter lesions (N = 10) and ipsilateral CST projections (N = 11) compared to children with periventricular white matter lesions (N = 24; p < 0.02) and contralateral CST projections (N = 9; p < 0.025), respectively. Moderate to high correlations were found between diffusion metrics of the targeted tracts and upper limb function (r = 0.45-0.72; p < 0.01). Asymmetry indices of the CST and sensory tracts could best explain bimanual performance (74%, p < 0.0001) and unimanual capacity (50%, p = 0.004). Adding lesion timing and CST wiring pattern did not further improve the model of bimanual performance, while for unimanual capacity lesion timing was additionally retained (58%, p = 0.0002). These results contribute to a better understanding of the underlying neuropathology of upper limb function in children with unilateral CP and point towards a clinical potential of tractography.Keywords:Brain injuries; Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Unilateral cerebral palsy; Upper extremity.

39,Transcranial Static Magnetic Field Stimulation of the Motor Cortex in Children.,"Background:Non-invasive neuromodulation is an emerging therapy for children with early brain injury but is difficult to apply to preschoolers when windows of developmental plasticity are optimal. Transcranial static magnetic field stimulation (tSMS) decreases primary motor cortex (M1) excitability in adults but effects on the developing brain are unstudied.Objective/hypothesis:We aimed to determine the effects of tSMS on cortical excitability and motor learning in healthy children. We hypothesized that tSMS over right M1 would reduce cortical excitability and inhibit contralateral motor learning.Methods:This randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded, three-arm, cross-over trial enrolled 24 healthy children aged 10-18 years. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) assessed cortical excitability via motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and paired pulse measures. Motor learning was assessed via the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT). A tSMS magnet (677 Newtons) or sham was held over left or right M1 for 30 min while participants trained the non-dominant hand. A linear mixed effect model was used to examine intervention effects.Results:All 72 tSMS sessions were well tolerated without serious adverse effects. Neither cortical excitability as measured by MEPs nor paired-pulse intracortical neurophysiology was altered by tSMS. Possible behavioral effects included contralateral tSMS inhibiting early motor learning (p < 0.01) and ipsilateral tSMS facilitating later stages of motor learning (p < 0.01) in the trained non-dominant hand.Conclusion:tSMS is feasible in pediatric populations. Unlike adults, tSMS did not produce measurable changes in MEP amplitude. Possible effects of M1 tSMS on motor learning require further study. Our findings support further exploration of tSMS neuromodulation in young children with cerebral palsy.Keywords:motor learning; neuromodulation; neurophysiology; non-invasive brain stimulation; pediatrics; tSMS.

40,Safety and tolerability of transcranial magnetic and direct current stimulation in children: Prospective single center evidence from 3.5 million stimulations.,"Background:Non-invasive brain stimulation is being increasingly used to interrogate neurophysiology and modulate brain function. Despite the high scientific and therapeutic potential of non-invasive brain stimulation, experience in the developing brain has been limited.Objective:To determine the safety and tolerability of non-invasive neurostimulation in children across diverse modalities of stimulation and pediatric populations.Methods:A non-invasive brain stimulation program was established in 2008 at our pediatric, academic institution. Multi-disciplinary neurophysiological studies included single- and paired-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) methods. Motor mapping employed robotic TMS. Interventional trials included repetitive TMS (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Standardized safety and tolerability measures were completed prospectively by all participants.Results:Over 10 years, 384 children underwent brain stimulation (median 13 years, range 0.8-18.0). Populations included typical development (n = 118), perinatal stroke/cerebral palsy (n = 101), mild traumatic brain injury (n = 121) neuropsychiatric disorders (n = 37), and other (n = 7). No serious adverse events occurred. Drop-outs were rare (<1%). No seizures were reported despite >100 participants having brain injuries and/or epilepsy. Tolerability between single and paired-pulse TMS (542340 stimulations) and rTMS (3.0 million stimulations) was comparable and favourable. TMS-related headache was more common in perinatal stroke (40%) than healthy participants (13%) but was mild and self-limiting. Tolerability improved over time with side-effect frequency decreasing by >50%. Robotic TMS motor mapping was well-tolerated though neck pain was more common than with manual TMS (33% vs 3%). Across 612 tDCS sessions including 92 children, tolerability was favourable with mild itching/tingling reported in 37%.Conclusions:Standard non-invasive brain stimulation paradigms are safe and well-tolerated in children and should be considered minimal risk. Advancement of applications in the developing brain are warranted. A new and improved pediatric NIBS safety and tolerability form is included.Keywords:Children; HD-tDCS; Safety; TMS; Tolerability; tDCS.

41,Ipsilateral Corticospinal Tract Excitability Contributes to the Severity of Mirror Movements in Unilateral Cerebral Palsy: A Case Series.,"Mirror movements (MM) can be a clinical manifestation of unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP) causing involuntary movements when attempting to use either hand for functional activities. Atypical development of the corticospinal tract (CST) contributes to impairments in observed motor movements and functional activities. However, little is known about the underlying neurophysiology and contribution of the CST to MM. The current case study characterizes MM in 13 children and young adults with UCP ranging in age from 7 to 19 years and includes clinical and neurophysiologic variables. Clinical profiles included MM of each hand (ie, Woods and Teuber), bimanual coordination and hand use (Assisting Hand Assessment [AHA]), and perception of performance (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure [COPM]). We measured the strength of motor-evoked potentials (MEP) elicited from single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of each hemisphere to create a ratio of hemispheric responses. Our sample included three types of CST circuitry: ipsilateral (n = 5), bilateral (n = 3), and contralateral (n = 4). The MEP ratio ranged from 0 to 1.45 (median 0.11) with greater MM observed in participants with ratios greater than 0.5. We observed a positive relationship between the MEP ratio and the more-affected MM score, meaning participants with larger ipsilateral responses from contralesional stimulation (eg, the contralesional hemisphere was stimulated with TMS resulting in an ipsilateral MEP response), as compared with contralateral responses, displayed greater MM than those that did not. There was no relationship between MM and function as measured by the AHA or COPM. These findings suggest a role of the contralesional hemisphere to MM, which could serve as a therapeutic target for interventions.Keywords:cerebral palsy; corticospinal tract; mirror movements; neonate; noninvasive brain stimulation; pediatric.

Compensation and Reorganization of a Damaged Human Brain with Intensive Physical Training.","The main aim of the study was to evaluate how the brain of a Paralympic athlete with severe disability due to cerebral palsy has reorganized after continuous training geared to enhance performance. Both corticospinal excitability of upper-limb muscles and electromyographic activity during swimming were investigated for a Paralympic gold medalist in swimming competitions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the affected and intact hand motor cortical area revealed that the affected side finger muscle cortical representation area shifted towards the temporal side, and cortico-spinal excitability of the target muscle was prominently facilitated, i.e., the maximum motor evoked potential in the affected side, 6.11 ± 0.19 mV was greater than that in the intact side, 4.52 ± 0.39 mV (mean ± standard error). Electromyographic activities during swimming demonstrated well-coordinated patterns as compared with rather spastic activities observed in the affected side during walking on land. These results suggest that the ability of the brain to reorganize through intensive training in Paralympic athletes can teach interesting lessons to the field neurorehabilitation.Keywords:Paralympic sports; case study; electromyography (EMG); female; motivation; neurorehabilitation; swimming.

43,EMG breakthrough during cortical silent period in congenital hemiparesis: a descriptive case series.,"Background:The cortical silent period is a transient suppression of electromyographic activity after a transcranial magnetic stimulation pulse, attributed to spinal and supraspinal inhibitory mechanisms. Electromyographic breakthrough activity has been observed in healthy adults as a result of a spinal reflex response within the cortical silent period.Objectives:The objective of this case series is to report the ipsilesional and contralesional cortical silent period and the electromyographic breakthrough activity of 7 children with congenital hemiparesis.Methods:TMS was delivered over the ipsilesional and contralesional primary motor cortices with resting motor threshold and cortical silent period measures recorded from first dorsal interosseous muscle.Results:Seven children (13±2 years) were included. Ipsilesional and contralesional resting motor thresholds ranged from 49 to 80% and from 38 to 63% of maximum stimulator output, respectively. Ipsilesional (n=4) and contralesional (n=7) cortical silent period duration ranged from 49 to 206ms and 81 to 150ms, respectively. Electromyographic breakthrough activity was observed ipsilesionally in 3/4 (75%) and contralesionally in 3/7 (42.8%) participants. In the 3 children with ipsilesional breakthrough activity during the cortical silent period, all testing trials showed breakthrough. Contralesional breakthrough activity was observed in only one of the analyzable trials in each of those 3 participants. The mean peak amplitude of breakthrough activity ranged from 45 to 214μV (ipsilesional) and from 23 to 93μV (contralesional).Conclusion:Further research is warranted to understand the mechanisms and significance of electromyographic breakthrough activity within the cortical silent period in congenital hemiparesis. Understanding these mechanisms may lead to the design of tailored neuromodulation interventions for physical rehabilitation.Trial registration:

44,Longitudinal assessment of 1H-MRS (GABA and Glx) and TMS measures of cortical inhibition and facilitation in the sensorimotor cortex.,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the long-term stability of water-referenced GABA and Glx neurometabolite concentrations in the sensorimotor cortex using MRS and to assess the long-term stability of GABA- and glutamate-related intracortical excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Healthy individuals underwent two sessions of MRS and TMS at a 3-month interval. A MEGA-PRESS sequence was used at 3 T to acquire MRS signals in the sensorimotor cortex. Metabolites were quantified by basis spectra fitting and metabolite concentrations were derived using unsuppressed water reference scans accounting for relaxation and partial volume effects. TMS was performed using published standards. After performing stability and reliability analyses for MRS and TMS, reliable change indexes were computed for all measures with a statistically significant test-retest correlation. No significant effect of time was found for GABA, Glx and TMS measures. There was an excellent ICC and a strong correlation across time for GABA and Glx. Analysis of TMS measure stability revealed an excellent ICC for rMT CSP and %MSO and a fair ICC for 2 ms SICI. There was no significant correlation between MRS and TMS measures at any time point. This study shows that MRS-GABA and MRS-Glx of the sensorimotor cortex have good stability over a 3-month period, with variability across time comparable to that reported in other brain areas. While resting motor threshold, %MSO and CSP were found to be stable and reliable, other TMS measures had greater variability and lesser reliability.Keywords:GABA; Glutamate; MEGA-PRESS; Magnetic resonance; Motor cortex; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

45,Can neuromodulation techniques optimally exploit cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit properties to enhance motor learning post-stroke?,"Individuals post-stroke sustain motor deficits years after the stroke. Despite recent advancements in the applications of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques and Deep Brain Stimulation in humans, there is a lack of evidence supporting their use for rehabilitation after brain lesions. Non-invasive brain stimulation is already in use for treating motor deficits in individuals with Parkinson's disease and post-stroke. Deep Brain Stimulation has become an established treatment for individuals with movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, epilepsy, cerebral palsy and dystonia. It has also been utilized for the treatment of Tourette's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and neuropsychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depression and anorexia nervosa. There exists growing scientific knowledge from animal studies supporting the use of Deep Brain Stimulation to enhance motor recovery after brain damage. Nevertheless, these results are currently not applicable to humans. This review details the current literature supporting the use of these techniques to enhance motor recovery, both from human and animal studies, aiming to encourage development in this domain.Keywords:cerebellum; deep brain stimulation; neuromodulation; non-invasive brain stimulation; stroke.

46,Task load modulates tDCS effects on language performance.,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) effects in cognition are inconsistent across studies. This study aimed to discuss why typical models might be insufficient to explain these effects, and to investigate a brain state factor, task load, with behavioral experiments on phonological processing. The motor theory of speech perception states that motor codes for articulation take part in speech perception, a view sharpened by neuroimaging findings, which show that the motor role in phonological processing is weighted by the nature of the tasks. Three groups of 20 participants, each under a different tDCS condition (anodal, cathodal, or sham), performed a categorical perception (CP), a lexical decision (LD), and a word naming (WN) task while stimulated on the pars opercularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus, a language area typically involved with the motor role. These tasks were assumed to be subserved by a network of nodes which included the target, believed to be increasingly relevant for performance from speech perception to speech production. A-tDCS facilitation and C-tDCS downregulation should directly increase with the relevance of the target for the task. Downregulation of a low relevance node could result in facilitation by compensation from other nodes. Overall, our brain stimulation findings support the neuroimaging literature in that motor participation in phonological processing depends on task nature and show that tDCS effects are modulated by task load relative to the target. Outcomes such as the improved performance following cathodal tDCS in CP and WN suggest that compensatory mechanisms may take place when the tasks involve more complex neuronal networks.Keywords:cognition; language; pars opercularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFGop); phonological processing; task load; transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).

47,[Effect of acupuncture combined with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on motor function and cerebral hemodynamics in children with spastic cerebral palsy with spleen-kidney deficiency].,"Objective:To investigate the clinical effect of acupuncture combined with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of children with spastic cerebral palsy with spleen-kidney deficiency, as well as its effect in improving cerebral hemodynamics.Methods:A total of 220 children with spastic cerebral palsy were divided into observation group and control group using a random number table, with 110 children in each group. The children in the control group were given rehabilitation training and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and those in the observation group were given acupuncture in addition to the treatment in the control group. Acupuncture was performed at Zusanli (ST36), Xuanzhong (GB39), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Pishu (BL20), Shenshu (BL23), Qihai (CV6), Quchi (LI11), Neiguan (PC6), Hegu (LI4) and Tianshu (ST25) once every other day, three times a week for 3 consecutive months. The two groups were compared in terms of Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM), Fine Motor Function Measure (FMFM), comprehensive function score for children with cerebral palsy, clinical outcome, and related cerebral hemodynamic parameters (mean blood flow velocity [Vm], systolic peak velocity [Vs], and resistance index [RI] of the cerebral artery).Results:After treatment, both groups had significant increases in the scores of GMFM, FMFM and comprehensive function (cognitive function, speech function, motor ability, self-care, and social adaptability,P<0.01), and the observation group had significantly better improvements in the scores of GMFM (domains A, B and C), FMFM (domains B, C, D and E), and comprehensive function than those of the control group (P<0.01). The therapeutic effect of the observation group (93/110, 84.55%)was superior to that of the control group (80/110, 72.73%, P<0.05). The observation group had significantly higher Vs and Vm and a significantly lower RI than the control group (P<0.01).Conclusion:In the treatment of children with spasmodic cerebral palsy with spleen-kidney deficiency, acupuncture combined with repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation can significantly improve their motor function, comprehensive function, and clinical outcome, which may be associated with the regulation of cerebral hemodynamics.Keywords:Acupuncture; Cerebral hemodynamics; Spastic cerebral palsy; Spleen-kidney deficiency.

48,Noninvasive Brain Stimulation for Rehabilitation of Pediatric Motor Disorders Following Brain Injury: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Objective:To assess the evidence of the effectiveness of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) for rehabilitation of pediatric motor disorders after brain injury.Data sources:Ovid, Cochrane, Science Direct, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases were searched up to August 2017 by 2 independent reviewers.Study selection:Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English were included if they met the following criteria.Population:Pediatric patients with motor disorders following brain injury.Intervention:NIBS, including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).Outcomes:Measures related to motor disorders (upper limb functional abilities, gait, balance, and spasticity). Fourteen RCTs were included (10 studies used tDCS, while 4 studies used rTMS).Data extraction:Predefined data were tabulated by 1 reviewer and verified by another reviewer. Methodological quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale; also levels of evidence adapted from Sackett were used.Data synthesis:A grouped meta-analysis was performed on balance, gait parameters, and upper limb function. Data were pooled using a random-effects model to assess the immediate effect and 1-month follow-up of NIBS. According to the PEDro scale, 3 studies were excellent, 8 studies were good, and 3 studies were fair. The level of evidence of all of the included studies was 1b, except for 3 studies with grade 2a. There were significant improvements in all upper limb functions (standardized mean differences [SMDs] ranging from 0.94 to 1.83 [P values=.0001]), balance (SMDs ranging between -0.48 to 0.83 [P values<.05]) and some gait variables.Conclusion:Pediatric patients with brain injury can be safely stimulated by NIBS, and there is evidence for the efficacy of rTMS in improving upper limb function, and tDCS in improving balance and majority of gait variables with persisted effects for 1 month. The efficacy of spasticity is uncertain.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; Motor disorders; Rehabilitation; Transcranial direct current stimulation; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

49,Bimanual Skill Learning after Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Children with Unilateral Cerebral Palsy: A Brief Report.,"Bimanual skills are important for goal-oriented activities. Children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP) have deficits in unimanual and bimanual motor control and learning. The application of non-invasive brain stimulation with existing motor training may further promote motor learning; however, the effects of stimulation on bimanual learning have not been examined. Here, we assessed the performance of a novel bimanual skill (modified Speed Stacks task) in eight children with UCP before, during, and after a combined motor training and brain stimulation intervention. Participants received 10 days (120 min/day) of goal-oriented bimanual therapy combined initially with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS, 20 min/day). Results showed task improvement tapered (p < 0.001) during and after the intervention and task variability decreased in 6/8 participants, indicating the potential impact of novel rehabilitation to improve skill learning in children with UCP. Future work is required to understand how both tDCS and bimanual training contribute to learning bimanual tasks.Keywords:Bimanual learning; transcranial direct current stimulation; unilateral cerebral palsy.

50,Motor Evoked Potentials as Potential Biomarkers of Early Atypical Corticospinal Tract Development in Infants with Perinatal Stroke.,"Diagnosis of cerebral palsy (CP) after perinatal stroke is often delayed beyond infancy, a period of rapid neuromotor development with heightened potential for rehabilitation. This study sought to assess whether the presence or absence of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) could be an early biomarker of atypical development within the first year of life. In 10 infants with perinatal stroke, motor outcome was assessed with a standardized movement assessment. Single-pulse TMS was utilized to assess presence of MEPs. Younger infants (3-6 months CA, n = 5, 4/5 (80%)) were more likely to present with an MEP from the more-affected hemisphere (MAH) compared to older infants (7-12 months CA, n = 5, 0/5, (0%)) (p = 0.048). Atypical movement was demonstrated in the majority of infants with an absent MEP from the MAH (5/6, 83%) compared to those with a present MEP (1/4, 25%) (p = 0.191). We found that age influences the ability to elicit an MEP from the MAH, and motor outcome may be related to MAH MEP absence. Assessment of MEPs in conjunction with current practice of neuroimaging and motor assessments could promote early detection and intervention in infants at risk of CP.Keywords:cerebral palsy; infant; non-invasive brain stimulation; pediatrics; perinatal stroke; transcranial magnetic stimulation.

51,Mirror movements in children with unilateral cerebral palsy due to perinatal stroke: clinical correlates of plasticity reorganization.,"inEnglish,Spanish,PortugueseAim:We aimed to determine if the mirror movements that often result in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) after perinatal stroke represent a clinical biomarker of developmental plasticity.Method:This was a prospective, controlled cohort study. Mirror movements in children with unilateral CP from a population-based cohort were compared to those of typically developing controls. The population with stroke was assessed further via electromyography (EMG), motor function, and corticospinal organization investigations. Mirror movements were quantified (0-5) bidirectionally. EMG mirror movements were quantified during voluntary contraction. Motor function was quantified by validated measures including the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA). Corticospinal organization was categorized as ipsilateral or contralateral using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The relationships between mirror movements, function, and corticospinal organization were assessed (t-tests, Pearson rank correlation coefficients).Results:Ninety-two participants were scored (55 males, 37 females, mean [SD] 12y [5y 6mo], range 4-17y), 63 with complete motor outcomes and 39 with TMS data. EMG ratios correlated with clinical mirror movements (r=0.562, p=0.008). Mild mirror activity in controls declined with age (r=-0.459, p<0.001). Mirroring was stronger with tasks performed by the affected hand (p<0.001). Mirror movements correlated with AHA scores (r=-0.255, p=0.04) and poor motor outcome (p<0.001). Unaffected hand mirror activity was higher in children with ipsilateral corticospinal tract arrangements (p<0.001).Interpretation:Clinical mirror movements correlate with disability and corticospinal organization in children with unilateral CP with perinatal stroke. This simple bedside biomarker could facilitate patient selection for personalized rehabilitation.What this paper adds:Mirror movements are a clinical indicator of corticospinal organization in children with unilateral cerebral palsy with perinatal stroke. Mirroring is strongest in children with ipsilateral corticospinal tract reorganization. The concept of a 'directionality factor' to mirror movements highlights additional, clinically relevant functional correlations.MOVIMIENTOS EN ESPEJO EN NIÑOS CON PARÁLISIS CEREBRAL UNILATERAL DEBIDO A UN ACCIDENTE CEREBROVASCULAR PERINATAL: CORRELATOS CLÍNICOS DE REORGANIZACIÓN DE LA PLASTICIDAD: OBJETIVO: Nuestro objetivo fue determinar si los movimientos en espejo que a menudo presentan niños con parálisis cerebral unilateral después de un accidente cerebrovascular perinatal representan un biomarcador clínico de la plasticidad del desarrollo.

52,Maturation of Corticospinal Tracts in Children With Hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy Assessed by Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.,"
Aim: To assess changes in the developmental trajectory of corticospinal tracts (CST) maturation in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP). Methods: Neuroimaging data were obtained from 36 children with HCP for both the more affected (MA) and less affected (LA) hemispheres, and, for purposes of direct comparison, between groups, 15 typically developing (TD) children. With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we estimated the mean fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), mean diffusivity (MD), and radial diffusivity (RD) of the corticospinal tract, parameters indicative of factors including myelination and axon density. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was performed as a neurophysiologic measure of corticospinal tract integrity and organization. Resting motor threshold (rMT) was obtained per hemisphere, per patient. Results: We observed a significant AD and MD developmental trajectory, both of which were inversely related to age (decrease in AD and diffusivity corresponding to increased age) in both hemispheres of TD children (p < 0.001). This maturation process was absent in both MA and LA hemispheres of children with HCP. Additionally, the TMS-derived previously established rMT developmental trajectory was preserved in the LA hemisphere of children with HCP (n = 26; p < 0.0001) but this trajectory was absent in the MA hemisphere. Conclusions: Corticospinal tract maturation arrests in both hemispheres of children with HCP, possibly reflecting perinatal disruption of corticospinal tract myelination and axonal integrity.Keywords:corticospinal tracts; development; hemiplegic cerebral palsy; maturation; transcranial magnetic stimulation.

53,Static magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex impairs online but not offline motor sequence learning.,"Static magnetic fields (SMFs) are known to alter neural activity, but evidence of their ability to modify learning-related neuroplasticity is lacking. The present study tested the hypothesis that application of static magnetic stimulation (SMS), an SMF applied transcranially via a neodymium magnet, over the primary motor cortex (M1) would alter learning of a serial reaction time task (SRTT). Thirty-nine participants took part in two experimental sessions separated by 24 h where they had to learn the SRTT with their right hand. During the first session, two groups received SMS either over contralateral (i.e., left) or ipsilateral (i.e., right) M1 while a third group received sham stimulation. SMS was not applied during the second session. Results of the first session showed that application of SMS over contralateral M1 impaired online learning as compared to both ipsilateral and sham groups, which did not differ. Results further revealed that application of SMS did not impair offline learning or relearning. Overall, these results are in line with those obtained using other neuromodulatory techniques believed to reduce cortical excitability in the context of motor learning and suggest that the ability of SMS to alter learning-related neuroplasticity is temporally circumscribed to the duration of its application."

55,Increasing Number of Therapy Sessions of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Improves Motor Development by Reducing Muscle Spasticity in Cerebral Palsy Children.,"Background:Repetitive TMS (rTMS), a non-invasive neuro-stimulation tool based on the principle of electromagnetic induction is recently being employed both for investigational and interventional purposes. The stimulating effect of rTMS on motor cortex areas of the brain leads to increased motor activity and decreased muscle tone in spastic cerebral palsy (CP) patients.Objective:This modulatory effect of rTMS is used in this study to evaluate its effect on motor function and spasticity by increasing the number of therapy session and keeping frequency of 10Hz and pulse train of 2500 constant.Methods:Total thirty spastic CP patients participated in this study after written informed consent from their parents/guardians. The participants were equally divided into three groups, namely, S-20, S-30 and S-40 depending on the number of therapy sessions. The mean age±SD of participants in different groups were 8.9±3.6, 9.5±2.9 and 8.4±3.5 in S-20, S-30 and S-40 respectively. Participants in S-20, S-30 and S-40 were provided 20, 30 and 40 sessions of rTMS therapy respectively followed by physical therapy of 30 minutes daily. Each rTMS session was of 25 minutes duration and was administered once daily for 5 days a week. Prior to start and after completion of the therapy, pre and post assessment of gross motor function measure (GMFM) for motor function and modified Ashworth scale (MAS) for muscle spasticity was performed on all the participants.Outcomes:The result of pre-versus-post GMFM score showed that 4.27%, 3.12% and 2.36% motor gain was obtained after 40, 30 and 20 sessions of therapy respectively. In addition, significant reduction in spasticity in both upper and limb muscles was also observed in all the three groups.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; Modified Ashworth Scale; gross motor function measure; spasticity; transcranial magnetic stimulation.

56,Effect of Anodic tDCS Over Motor Cortex Versus Cerebellum in Cerebral Palsy: A Study Protocol.,"Purpose:To compare the clinical and functional effects of treadmill training combined with anodic transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) on the primary motor cortex (Cz), specifically on the area of motor cortex representation of the lower limbs, and on the cerebellum (Cb) in children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP).Methods:Thirty children and adolescents with spastic CP will be randomly allocated in 3 groups: (1) treadmill training and atDCS on Cz; (2) treadmill training and atDCS on Cb; (3) treadmill training and sham tDCS on Cz. Evaluations of gait spatial-temporal parameters, functional mobility, functional balance, gross motor function, and functional performance will be performed 1 week before intervention and 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after intervention. Every 3 months the participants will cross over groups.Discussion:This is a protocol for an intervention study comparing the clinical and functional effects of atDCS over Cz and Cb."
57,Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on balance improvement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"
Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as a promising therapeutic tool to improve balance and optimize rehabilitation strategies. However, current literature shows the methodological heterogeneity of tDCS protocols and results, hindering any clear conclusions about the effects of tDCS on postural control. Objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of tDCS on postural control, and identify the most beneficial target brain areas and the effect on different populations. Methods: Two independent reviewers selected randomized tDCS clinical-trials studies from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and reference lists of retrieved articles published between 1998 and 2017. Most frequently reported centre of pressure (COP) variables were selected for meta-analysis. Other postural control outcomes were discussed in the review. Results: Thirty studies were included in the systematic review, and 11 were submitted to a meta-analysis. A reduction of COP displacement area has been significantly achieved by tDCS, evidencing an improvement in balance control. Individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) and healthy young adults are mostly affected by stimulation. The analysis of the impact of tDCS over different brain areas revealed a significant effect after primary motor cortex (M1) stimulation, however, with no clear results after cerebellar stimulation due to divergent results among studies. Conclusions: tDCS appears to improve balance control, more evident in healthy and CP subjects. Effects are observed when primary MI is stimulated. Cerebellar stimulation should be better investigated.Keywords:Postural balance; meta-analysis; transcranial direct current stimulation.

58,Contribution of corticospinal drive to ankle plantar flexor muscle activation during gait in adults with cerebral palsy.,"Impaired plantar flexor muscle activation during push-off in late stance contributes importantly to reduced gait ability in adults with cerebral palsy (CP). Here we used low-intensity transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to suppress soleus EMG activity during push-off as an estimate of corticospinal drive in CP adults and neurologically intact (NI) adults. Ten CP adults (age 34 years, SD 14.6, GMFCS I-II) and ten NI adults (age 33 years, SD 9.8) walked on a treadmill at their preferred walking speed. TMS of the leg motor cortex was elicited just prior to push-off during gait at intensities below threshold for motor-evoked potentials. Soleus EMG from steps with and without TMS were averaged and compared. Control experiments were performed while standing and in NI adults during gait at slow speed. TMS induced a suppression at a latency of about 40 ms. This suppression was similar in the two populations when differences in control EMG and gait speed were taken into account (CP 18%, NI 16%). The threshold of the suppression was higher in CP adults. The findings suggest that corticospinal drive to ankle plantar flexors at push-off is comparable in CP and NI adults. The higher threshold of the suppression in CP adults may reflect downregulation of cortical inhibition to facilitate corticospinal drive. Interventions aiming to facilitate excitability in cortical networks may contribute to maintain or even improve efficient gait in CP adults.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; Corticospinal drive; Plantar flexor muscles; Push-off.

59,Safety and Feasibility of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation as an Exploratory Assessment of Corticospinal Connectivity in Infants After Perinatal Brain Injury: An Observational Study.,"Background:Perinatal brain injuries often impact the corticospinal system, leading to motor impairment and cerebral palsy. Although transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been widely used to study corticospinal connectivity in adults and older children, similar studies of young infants are limited.Objectives:The objective was to establish the safety and feasibility of advanced TMS assessments of the corticospinal connectivity of young infants with perinatal brain injury.Design:This was a pilot, cross-sectional study of 3- to 12-month-old (corrected age) infants with perinatal stroke or intracranial hemorrhage.Methods:Six participants (2 term, 4 preterm) were assessed with stereotactic neuronavigation-guided TMS. Single-pulse TMS was applied to each hemisphere and responses were recorded simultaneously from both upper limbs. During data collection, vital signs and stress responses were measured to assess safety. Developmental motor outcomes were evaluated using the General Movements Assessment and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (3rd edition). A clinical diagnosis of cerebral palsy was recorded, if available.Results:No adverse events occurred during TMS testing. All sessions were well tolerated. Contralateral motor evoked responses were detected in 4 of 6 participants. Both contralateral and ipsilateral responses were observed in 2 of 6 participants.Limitations:TMS responses were not obtained in all participants. This could be related to the location of brain injury or developmental stage of the corticospinal system controlling the wrist flexor muscle group from which responses were recorded.Conclusions:This study provides a summary of the framework for performing novel TMS assessments in infants with perinatal brain injury. Implementing this approach to measure corticospinal connectivity in hypothesis-driven studies in young infants appears to be justified. Such studies could inform the characterization of corticospinal development and the neural mechanisms driving recovery following early interventions."
60,Influence of Combined Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Motor Training on Corticospinal Excitability in Children With Unilateral Cerebral Palsy.,"Combined non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) and rehabilitation interventions have the potential to improve function in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP), however their effects on developing brain function are not well understood. In a proof-of-principle study, we used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to measure changes in corticospinal excitability and relationships to motor performance following a randomized controlled trial consisting of 10 days of combined constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the contralesional motor cortex. Twenty children and young adults (mean age = 12 years, 9 months, range = 7 years, 7 months, 21 years, 7 months) with UCP participated. TMS testing was performed before, after, and 6 months after the intervention to measure motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and cortical silent period (CSP) duration. The association between neurophysiologic and motor outcomes and differences in excitability between hemispheres were examined. Contralesional MEP amplitude decreased as hypothesized in five of five participants receiving active tDCS immediately after and 6 months after the intervention, however no statistically significant differences between intervention groups were noted for MEP amplitude [mean difference = -323.9 μV, 95% CI = (-989, 341), p = 0.34] or CSP duration [mean difference = 3.9 ms, 95% CI = (-7.7, 15.5), p = 0.51]. Changes in corticospinal excitability were not statistically associated with improvements in hand function after the intervention. Across all participants, MEP amplitudes measured in the more-affected hand from both contralesional (mean difference = -474.5 μV) and ipsilesional hemispheres (-624.5 μV) were smaller compared to the less-affected hand. Assessing neurophysiologic changes after tDCS in children with UCP provides an understanding of long-term effects on brain excitability to help determine its potential as a therapeutic intervention. Additional investigation into the neurophysiologic effects of tDCS in larger samples of children with UCP are needed to confirm these findings.Keywords:cerebral palsy; corticospinal excitability; pediatric hemiparesis; rehabilitation; transcranial direct current stimulation.

61,Imaging functional motor connectivity in hemiparetic children with perinatal stroke.,"Perinatal stroke causes lifelong disability, particularly hemiparetic cerebral palsy. Arterial ischemic strokes (AIS) are large, cortical, and subcortical injuries acquired near birth due to acute occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Periventricular venous infarctions (PVI) are smaller, subcortical strokes acquired prior to 34 weeks gestation involving injury to the periventricular white matter. Both stroke types can damage motor pathways, thus, we investigated resulting alterations in functional motor networks and probed function. We measured blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fluctuations at rest in 38 participants [10 arterial patients (age = 14.7 ± 4.1 years), 10 venous patients (age = 13.5 ± 3.7 years), and 18 typically developing controls (TDCs) (age = 15.3 ± 5.1 years)] and explored strength and laterality of functional connectivity in the motor network. Inclusion criteria included MRI-confirmed, unilateral perinatal stroke, symptomatic hemiparetic cerebral palsy, and 6-19 years old at time of imaging. Seed-based functional connectivity analyses measured temporal correlations in BOLD response over the whole brain using primary motor cortices as seeds. Laterality indices based on mean z-scores in lesioned and nonlesioned hemispheres explored laterality. In AIS patients, significant differences in both strength and laterality of motor network connections were observed compared with TDCs. In PVI patients, motor networks largely resembled those of healthy controls, albeit slightly weaker and asymmetric, despite subcortical damage and hemiparesis. Functional connectivity strengths were not related to motor outcome scores for either stroke group. This study serves as a foundation to better understand how resting-state fMRI can assess motor functional connectivity and potentially be applied to explore mechanisms of interventional therapies after perinatal stroke.Keywords:cerebral palsy; functional connectivity; motor networks; pediatric; perinatal stroke; resting-state fMRI.

62,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Pediatric Motor Disorders: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Objective:To systematically examine the safety and effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) interventions in pediatric motor disorders.Data sources:PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, CINAHL, Web of Science, and ProQuest databases were searched from inception to August 2018.Study selection:tDCS randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, conference proceedings, and dissertations in pediatric motor disorders were included. Two authors independently screened articles based on predefined inclusion criteria.Data extraction:Data related to participant demographics, intervention, and outcomes were extracted by 2 authors. Quality assessment was independently performed by 2 authors.Data synthesis:A total of 23 studies involving a total of 391 participants were included. There was no difference in dropout rates between active (1 of 144) and sham (1 of 144) tDCS groups, risk difference 0.0, 95% confidence interval (-.05 to .04). Across studies, the most common adverse effects in the active group were tingling (17.2%), discomfort (8.02%), itching (6.79%), and skin redness (4%). Across 3 studies in children with cerebral palsy, tDCS significantly improved gait velocity (MD=.23; 95% confidence interval [0.13-0.34]; P<.0005), stride length (MD=0.10; 95% confidence interval [0.05-0.15]; P<.0005), and cadence (MD=15.7; 95% confidence interval [9.72-21.68]; P<.0005). Mixed effects were found on balance, upper extremity function, and overflow movements in dystonia.Conclusion:Based on the studies reviewed, tDCS is a safe technique in pediatric motor disorders and may improve some gait measures and involuntary movements. Research to date in pediatric motor disorders shows limited effectiveness in improving balance and upper extremity function. tDCS may serve as a potential adjunct to pediatric rehabilitation; to better understand if tDCS is beneficial for pediatric motor disorders, more well-designed RCTs are needed.Keywords:Children; Motor disorders; Rehabilitation; Review; Transcranial direct current stimulation.

63,Electrode Placement in Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation-How Reliable Is the Determination of C3/C4?,"The 10/20 electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements system often guides electrode placement for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation. One targeted region of the brain is the primary motor cortex (M1) for motor recovery after stroke, among other clinical indications. M1 is identified by C3 and C4 of the 10/20 EEG system yet the reliability of 10/20 EEG measurements by novice research raters is unknown. We investigated the reliability of the 10/20 EEG measurements for C3 and C4 in 25 adult participants. Two novice raters were assessed for inter-rater reliability. Both raters received two hours of instruction from a registered neurodiagnostic technician. One of the raters completed the measurements across two testing days for intra-rater reliability. Relative reliability was determined using the intraclass coefficient (ICC) and absolute reliability. We observed a low to fair inter and intra-rater ICC for motor cortex measurements. The absolute reliability was <1.0 cm by different novice raters and on different days. Although a low error was observed, consideration of the integrity of the targeted region of the brain is critical when designing tDCS interventions in clinical populations who may have compromised brain structure, due to a lesion or altered anatomy.Keywords:Electroencephalogram; Non-invasive brain stimulation; adults; children; neuroplasticity; stroke; transcranial direct current stimulation.

64,Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation does not influence the neural adjustments associated with fatiguing contractions in a hand muscle.,"Purpose:The objective of the current study was to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the briefer time to failure of a submaximal contraction (C2) when performed 60 min after a similar contraction (C1), and the influence of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) applied over the motor cortex on these mechanisms.Methods:In two sessions, ten adults sustained two isometric contractions (35% of maximum) to failure with the abductor pollicis brevis (APB). Before C2, either a-tDCS or sham stimulation was applied over the motor cortex. Fatigue-related changes in Hoffmann (H) and long-latency (LLR) reflexes, motor-evoked potential (MEP) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation and associated silent period (SP), maximal motor wave (Mmax), voluntary activation (VA), electromyographic (EMG) activity and peak force (PT3) evoked by a 3 pulse-train (100 Hz) were investigated.Results:The results indicate that regardless of session, the time to failure was briefer (- 13%, p < 0.05) for C2 than C1, with no a-tDCS effect. During C1, MEP amplitude, SP duration and LLR amplitude increased, H-reflex amplitude did not change, and Mmax, VA and PT3 decreased (p < 0.05). Except for EMG activity that was greater during C2 than C1 (p < 0.001), all variables were similar in C1 and C2 (p > 0.05), and recovered their initial values after the 60-min rest, except PT3.Conclusions:The results of the current study indicate that a-tDCS did not influence corticospinal excitability and time to failure of C2 when performed with the APB. These observations may reflect a peripheral origin of the briefer C2 time to failure in the APB.Keywords:Electromyography; Fatigue; H reflex; Long-latency reflex; Motor-evoked potential; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

66,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in Unilateral Cerebral Palsy: A Pilot Study of Motor Effect.,"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is an emerging tool to improve upper limb motor functions after stroke acquired in adulthood; however, there is a paucity of reports on its efficacy for upper limb motor rehabilitation in congenital or early-acquired stroke. In this pilot study we have explored, for the first time, the immediate effects, and their short-term persistence, of a single application of anodal tDCS on chronic upper limb motor disorders in children and young individuals with Unilateral Cerebral Palsy (UCP). To this aim, in a crossover sham-controlled study, eight subjects aged 10-28 years with UCP underwent two sessions of active and sham tDCS. Anodal tDCS (1.5 mA, 20 min) was delivered over the primary motor cortex (M1) of the ipsilesional hemisphere. Results showed, only following the active stimulation, an immediate improvement in unimanual gross motor dexterity of hemiplegic, but not of nonhemiplegic, hand in Box and Block test (BBT). Such improvement remained stable for at least 90 minutes. Performance of both hands in Hand Grip Strength test was not modified by anodal tDCS. Improvement in BBT was unrelated to participants' age or lesion size, as revealed by MRI data analysis. No serious adverse effects occurred after tDCS; some mild and transient side effects (e.g., headache, tingling, and itchiness) were reported in a limited number of cases. This study provides an innovative contribution to scientific literature on the efficacy and safety of anodal tDCS in UCP. This trial is registered with NCT03137940."
67,Latin American and Caribbean consensus on noninvasive central nervous system neuromodulation for chronic pain management (LAC2-NIN-CP).,"Introduction:Chronic pain (CP) is highly prevalent and generally undertreated health condition. Noninvasive brain stimulation may contribute to decrease pain intensity and influence other aspects related to CP.Objective:To provide consensus-based recommendations for the use of noninvasive brain stimulation in clinical practice.Methods:Systematic review of the literature searching for randomized clinical trials followed by consensus panel. Recommendations also involved a cost-estimation study.Results:The systematic review wielded 24 transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and 22 repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) studies. The following recommendations were provided: (1) Level A for anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1) in fibromyalgia, and level B for peripheral neuropathic pain, abdominal pain, and migraine; bifrontal (F3/F4) tDCS and M1 high-definition (HD)-tDCS for fibromyalgia; Oz/Cz tDCS for migraine and for secondary benefits such as improvement in quality of life, decrease in anxiety, and increase in pressure pain threshold; (2) level A recommendation for high-frequency (HF) rTMS over M1 for fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain, and level B for myofascial or musculoskeletal pain, complex regional pain syndrome, and migraine; (3) level A recommendation against the use of anodal M1 tDCS for low back pain; and (4) level B recommendation against the use of HF rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the control of pain.Conclusion:Transcranial DCS and rTMS are recommended techniques to be used in the control of CP conditions, with low to moderate analgesic effects, and no severe adverse events. These recommendations are based on a systematic review of the literature and a consensus made by experts in the field. Readers should use it as part of the resources available to decision-making.Keywords:Mixed pain; Neuropathic pain; Nociceptive pain; rTMS; tDCS.

68,Full Activation Profiles and Integrity of Corticospinal Pathways in Adults With Bilateral Spastic Cerebral Palsy.,"Background:Dysfunction of corticospinal pathways has been implicated in motor impairments in people with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy (CP). While structural damage to corticospinal pathways in people with CP is known, its impact on the activation of these pathways is not.Objective:To provide the first, complete activation profile of corticospinal pathways in adults with CP using a full range of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) intensities and voluntary contractions.Methods:TMS targeted the soleus muscle of 16 adults with bilateral spastic CP and 15 neurologically intact (NI) control participants. Activation profiles were generated using motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) produced by varying both stimulation intensity and degree of voluntary muscle activity. Anatomical integrity of corticospinal pathways was also measured with diffusion tractography.Results:Participants with CP had smaller MEPs produced by TMS at 1.2× active motor threshold during submaximal (20%) muscle activity and smaller maximal MEPs produced under any combination of stimulation intensity and voluntary muscle activity. At a fixed stimulation intensity, increasing voluntary muscle activity facilitated MEP amplitudes to a lesser degree in the participants with CP. Consistent differences in diffusion tractography suggested structural abnormalities in the corticospinal pathways of participants with CP that correlated with maximal MEPs.Conclusion:People with bilateral spastic CP have impaired activation of low and high-threshold corticospinal pathways to soleus motoneurons by TMS and reduced facilitation by voluntary activity that may be associated with structural damage to these pathways. These impairments likely contribute to impaired voluntary movement.Keywords:cerebral palsy; diffusion tensor imaging; motor evoked potential; pyramidal tracts; transcranial magnetic stimulation.

69,Transcranial direct current stimulation for promoting motor function in cerebral palsy: a review.,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has the potential to improve motor function in a range of neurological conditions, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). Although there have been many studies assessing tDCS in adult stroke, the literature regarding the efficacy of tDCS in CP is more limited. This review therefore focuses on the neurophysiological and clinical findings in children and adolescents with CP. Initial studies applying anodal tDCS to promote lower limb function are promising, with improvements in gait, mobility and balance reported. However, the results of upper limb studies are mixed and more research is needed. Studies investigating neurophysiological changes or predictors of response are also lacking. Large-scale longitudinal studies are needed for the lower limb to ascertain whether the initial pilot results translate into clinically meaningful improvements. Future studies of the upper limb should focus on determining the optimal stimulation parameters and consider tailoring stimulation to the individual based on the (re)organisation of their motor system.Keywords:Brain stimulation; Cerebral palsy; Lower limb; Motor function; Transcranial direct current stimulation; Upper limb.

70,Sensorimotor Robotic Measures of tDCS- and HD-tDCS-Enhanced Motor Learning in Children.,"Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) enhances motor learning in adults. We have demonstrated that anodal tDCS and high-definition (HD) tDCS of the motor cortex can enhance motor skill acquisition in children, but behavioral mechanisms remain unknown. Robotics can objectively quantify complex sensorimotor functions to better understand mechanisms of motor learning. We aimed to characterize changes in sensorimotor function induced by tDCS and HD-tDCS paired motor learning in children within an interventional trial. Healthy, right-handed children (12-18 y) were randomized to anodal tDCS, HD-tDCS, or sham targeting the right primary motor cortex during left-hand Purdue pegboard test (PPT) training over five consecutive days. A KINARM robotic protocol quantifying proprioception, kinesthesia, visually guided reaching, and an object hit task was completed at baseline, posttraining, and six weeks later. Effects of the treatment group and training on changes in sensorimotor parameters were explored. Twenty-four children (median 15.5 years, 52% female) completed all measures. Compared to sham, both tDCS and HD-tDCS demonstrated enhanced motor learning with medium effect sizes. At baseline, multiple KINARM measures correlated with PPT performance. Following training, visually guided reaching in all groups was faster and required less corrective movements in the trained arm (H(2) = 9.250, p = 0.010). Aspects of kinesthesia including initial direction error improved across groups with sustained effects at follow-up (H(2) = 9.000, p = 0.011). No changes with training or stimulation were observed for position sense. For the object hit task, the HD-tDCS group moved more quickly with the right hand compared to sham at posttraining (χ 2(2) = 6.255, p = 0.044). Robotics can quantify complex sensorimotor function within neuromodulator motor learning trials in children. Correlations with PPT performance suggest that KINARM metrics can assess motor learning effects. Understanding how tDCS and HD-tDCS enhance motor learning may be improved with robotic outcomes though specific mechanisms remain to be defined. Exploring mechanisms of neuromodulation may advance therapeutic approaches in children with cerebral palsy and other disabilities."
71,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) Paired with Occupation-Centered Bimanual Training in Children with Unilateral Cerebral Palsy: A Preliminary Study.,"Objective:We investigated the preliminary efficacy of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with bimanual training in children and young adults with unilateral cerebral palsy based on the principle of exaggerated interhemispheric inhibition (IHI).Methods:Eight participants with corticospinal tract (CST) connectivity from the lesioned hemisphere participated in an open-label study of 10 sessions of cathodal tDCS to the nonlesioned hemisphere (20 minutes) concurrently with bimanual, goal-directed training (120 minutes). We measured the frequency of adverse events and intervention efficacy with performance (bimanual-Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA)-and unimanual-Box and Blocks), self-report (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), ABILHAND), and neurophysiologic (motor-evoked potential amplitude, cortical silent period (CSP) duration, and motor mapping) assessments.Results:All participants completed the study with no serious adverse events. Three of 8 participants showed gains on the AHA, and 4 of 8 participants showed gains in Box and Blocks (more affected hand). Nonlesioned CSP duration decreased in 6 of 6 participants with analyzable data. Cortical representation of the first dorsal interosseous expanded in the nonlesioned hemisphere in 4 of 6 participants and decreased in the lesioned hemisphere in 3 of 4 participants with analyzable data.Conclusions:While goal achievement was observed, objective measures of hand function showed inconsistent gains. Neurophysiologic data suggests nonlinear responses to cathodal stimulation of the nonlesioned hemisphere. Future studies examining the contributions of activity-dependent competition and cortical excitability imbalances are indicated."
72,Intervention-Induced Motor Cortex Plasticity in Hemiparetic Children With Perinatal Stroke.,"Background:Clinical trials are suggesting efficacy of intensive therapy combined with brain stimulation to improve hand function in hemiparetic children with perinatal stroke. However, individual variability exists and the underlying neuroplasticity mechanisms are unknown. Exploring primary motor cortex (M1) neurophysiology, and how it changes with such interventions, may provide valuable biomarkers for advancing personalized neurorehabilitation.Methods:Forty-five children (age 6-19 years) with hemiparesis participated in PLASTIC CHAMPS, a blinded, sham-controlled, factorial clinical trial. All received 80 hours of goal-directed intensive upper extremity therapy. They were randomized into 4 groups: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of contralesional M1, constraint therapy, both, or neither. Stimulus recruitment curves (SRC), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) for lesioned and contralesional M1 were investigated using TMS. Clinical assessments including the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) were conducted pre- and postintervention.Results:All children completed the intervention and both function (AHA) and goal performance (COPM) improved with additive effects of rTMS and constraint ( P < .01). After intervention, motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes from the contralesional M1 to the less-affected hand increased (n = 16, P < .02). SRC from the contralesional M1 to the less-affected hand increased (n = 25, P < .01). SICI of the contralesional M1 to the less-affected hand decreased (n = 30, P < .04). No changes were observed for ICF in either hemisphere ( P > .12).Conclusion:TMS applied before/after intensive neuromodulation therapies can explore M1 neurophysiology and plasticity in children with cerebral palsy. Increased MEP sizes and decreased SICI may reflect mechanisms of interventional plasticity and be potential biomarkers of individualized medicine.Keywords:cerebral palsy; constraint induced movement therapy; hemiplegia; neurophysiology; perinatal stroke; transcranial magnetic stimulation.

73,Effects of High-Definition and Conventional Transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation on Motor Learning in Children.,"
Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can improve motor learning in children. High-definition approaches (HD-tDCS) have not been examined in children. Objectives/Hypothesis: We hypothesized that primary motor cortex HD-tDCS would enhance motor learning but be inferior to tDCS in children. Methods: Twenty-four children were recruited for a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded interventional trial (NCT03193580, clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03193580) to receive (1) right hemisphere (contralateral) primary motor cortex (M1) 1 mA anodal conventional 1 × 1 tDCS (tDCS), (2) right M1 1 mA anodal 4 × 1 HD-tDCS (HD-tDCS), or (3) sham. Over five consecutive days, participants trained their left hand using the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPTL). The Jebsen-Taylor Test, Serial Reaction Time Task, and right hand and bimanual PPT were also tested at baseline, post-training, and 6-week retention time (RT). Results: Both the tDCS and HD-tDCS groups demonstrated enhanced motor learning compared to sham with effects maintained at 6 weeks. Effect sizes were moderate-to-large for tDCS and HD-tDCS groups at the end of day 4 (Cohen's d tDCS = 0.960, HD-tDCS = 0.766) and day 5 (tDCS = 0.655, HD-tDCS = 0.851). Enhanced motor learning effects were also seen in the untrained hand. HD-tDCS was well tolerated and safe with no adverse effects. Conclusion: HD-tDCS and tDCS can enhance motor learning in children. Further exploration is indicated to advance rehabilitation therapies for children with motor disabilities such as cerebral palsy.

74,Evaluating the Effect of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Cerebral Palsy Children by Employing Electroencephalogram Signals.,"Introduction:Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a new tool that has been employed to modulate the neuronal activity of brain by its excitatory and inhibitory property. In cerebral palsy (CP) learning of any new task is an extremely slow process due to damage in sensory and motor areas of brain affecting the cognitive ability of the child and putting constraints in achieving timely developmental milestones. For such patients the electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most cost effective diagnostic tools used that minimizes hospital stay. Its analysis helps to identify various neurological disorders determining the role of brain waves outlining the present status of mind.Materials and methods:This study evaluated the EEG power spectrum density (PSD) of CP children both pre and post rTMS intervention to identify significance changes in signal patterns arising from different brain regions. thirty CP children participated in this study. Fifteen individuals underwent repetitive TMS (rTMS) therapy for 20 session comprising of 10 Hz frequency for 5 days a week for 4 weeks and another fifteen individual participated in activities of daily living for 20 sessions where they were administered mandatory standard therapy only. pre- EEG versus post EEG data recorded and analyzed employing the standard montage configuration. PSD was extracted employing fast fourier transform post acquisition of artifact free signal to undermine changes in signal pattern.Discussion and conclusion:The results revealed that rTMS improves learning ability in CP children and it shows higher power peak at frequency of 50 Hz and lower power peak frequency at 100 Hz. The power intensity in gamma wave region shows significant reduction post-rTMS therapy between 38-24 power peak frequency and 7-4 range in 100 Hz power peak frequency. In future, it will be used as effective tool as memory enhancers, especially for children with neurological disorders.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; cognitive ability; electroencephalograph; transcranial magnetic stimulation.

76,Transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation on Motor Function in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy: A Systematic Review.,"Purpose:To determine effects of transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) on motor function for children with cerebral palsy.Methods:Six electronic databases were searched using terms related to tDCS, combined with functional deficits/associated clinical measures. Results were filtered, including randomized controlled trials in English and children with cerebral palsy. Data were extracted using standardized procedures, and the PEDro scale was used to assess quality and meta-analyses conducted.Results:From 135 articles, 9 studies with moderate quality met inclusion criteria. Six were included in 7 separate meta-analyses supporting a benefit of tDCS for static balance, only at follow-up. Benefits of tDCS on dynamic balance, step length, and mobility were not established.Conclusions:The findings from meta-analyses suggest that tDCS may provide improvements in static balance at follow-up in children with cerebral palsy and positive effects on gait velocity; however, there was heterogeneity. Further research is needed before this therapy can be endorsed."
77,The Combined Use of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Robotic Therapy for the Upper Limb.,"Neurologic disorders such as stroke and cerebral palsy are leading causes of long-term disability and can lead to severe incapacity and restriction of daily activities due to lower and upper limb impairments. Intensive physical and occupational therapy are still considered main treatments, but new adjunct therapies to standard rehabilitation that may optimize functional outcomes are being studied. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that polarizes underlying brain regions through the application of weak direct currents through electrodes on the scalp, modulating cortical excitability. Increased interest in this technique can be attributed to its low cost, ease of use, and effects on human neural plasticity. Recent research has been performed to determine the clinical potential of tDCS in diverse conditions such as depression, Parkinson's disease, and motor rehabilitation after stroke. tDCS helps enhance brain plasticity and seems to be a promising technique in rehabilitation programs. A number of robotic devices have been developed to assist in the rehabilitation of upper limb function after stroke. The rehabilitation of motor deficits is often a long process requiring multidisciplinary approaches for a patient to achieve maximum independence. These devices do not intend to replace manual rehabilitation therapy; instead, they were designed as an additional tool to rehabilitation programs, allowing immediate perception of results and tracking of improvements, thus helping patients to stay motivated. Both tDSC and robot-assisted therapy are promising add-ons to stroke rehabilitation and target the modulation of brain plasticity, with several reports describing their use to be associated with conventional therapy and the improvement of therapeutic outcomes. However, more recently, some small clinical trials have been developed that describe the associated use of tDCS and robot-assisted therapy in stroke rehabilitation. In this article, we describe the combined methods used in our institute for improving motor performance after stroke."
78,Corticospinal Tract Wiring and Brain Lesion Characteristics in Unilateral Cerebral Palsy: Determinants of Upper Limb Motor and Sensory Function.,"Brain lesion characteristics (timing, location, and extent) and the type of corticospinal tract (CST) wiring have been proposed as determinants of upper limb (UL) motor function in unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP), yet an investigation of the relative combined impact of these factors on both motor and sensory functions is still lacking. Here, we first investigated whether structural brain lesion characteristics could predict the underlying CST wiring and we explored the role of CST wiring and brain lesion characteristics to predict UL motor and sensory functions in uCP. Fifty-two participants with uCP (mean age (SD): 11 y and 3 m (3 y and 10 m)) underwent a single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation session to determine CST wiring between the motor cortex and the more affected hand (n = 17 contralateral, n = 19 ipsilateral, and n = 16 bilateral) and an MRI to determine lesion timing (n = 34 periventricular (PV) lesion, n = 18 corticosubcortical (CSC) lesion), location, and extent. Lesion location and extent were evaluated with a semiquantitative scale. A standardized protocol included UL motor (grip strength, unimanual capacity, and bimanual performance) and sensory measures. A combination of lesion locations (damage to the PLIC and frontal lobe) significantly contributed to differentiate between the CST wiring groups, reclassifying the participants in their original group with 57% of accuracy. Motor and sensory functions were influenced by each of the investigated neurological factors. However, multiple regression analyses showed that motor function was predicted by the CST wiring (more preserved in individuals with contralateral CST (p < 0.01)), lesion extent, and damage to the basal ganglia and thalamus. Sensory function was predicted by the combination of a large and later lesion and an ipsilateral or bilateral CST wiring, which led to increased sensory deficits (p < 0.05). These novel insights contribute to a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of UL function and may be useful to delineate individualized treatment strategies."
79,Hyperexcitability of brain stem pathways in cerebral palsy.,"Individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) experience impairments in the control of head and neck movements, suggesting dysfunction in brain stem circuitry. To examine if brain stem circuitry is altered in CP, we compared reflexes evoked in the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle by trigeminal nerve stimulation in adults with CP and in age/sex-matched controls. Increasing the intensity of trigeminal nerve stimulation produced progressive increases in the long-latency suppression of ongoing SCM electromyography in controls. In contrast, participants with CP showed progressively increased facilitation around the same reflex window, suggesting heightened excitability of brain stem pathways. We also examined if there was altered activation of cortico-brain stem pathways in response to prenatal injury of the brain. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the SCM that were conditioned by a prior trigeminal afferent stimulation were more facilitated in CP compared with controls, especially in ipsilateral MEPs that are likely mediated by corticoreticulospinal pathways. In some participants with CP, but not in controls, a combined trigeminal nerve and cortical stimulation near threshold intensities produced large, long-lasting responses in both the SCM and biceps brachii muscles. We propose that the enhanced excitatory responses evoked from trigeminal and cortical inputs in CP are produced by heightened excitability of brain stem circuits, resulting in the augmented activation of reticulospinal pathways. Enhanced activation of reticulospinal pathways in response to early injury of the corticospinal tract may provide a compensated activation of the spinal cord or, alternatively, contribute to impairments in the precise control of head and neck functions. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to show that in adults with spastic cerebral palsy, activation of brain stem circuits by cortical and/or trigeminal afferents produces excitatory responses in anterior neck muscles compared with inhibitory responses in age/sex-matched controls. This may reflect a more excitable reticulospinal tract in response to early brain injury to provide a compensated activation of postural muscles. On the other hand, a hyperexcitable brain stem may contribute to impairments in the precise control of head and neck functions.Keywords:biceps brachii; cerebral palsy; corticoreticulospinal; sternocleidomastoid; transcranial magnetic stimulation; trigeminal nerve; trigeminocervical reflex.

80,Combining constraint-induced movement therapy and action-observation training in children with unilateral cerebral palsy: a randomized controlled trial.,"Background:Upper limb (UL) deficits in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP) have traditionally been targeted with motor execution treatment models, such as modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (mCIMT). However, new approaches based on a neurophysiological model such as Action-Observation Training (AOT) may provide new opportunities for enhanced motor learning. The aim of this study is to describe a randomised controlled trial (RCT) protocol investigating the effects of an intensive treatment model, combining mCIMT and AOT compared to mCIMT alone on UL function in children with uCP. Additionally, the role of neurological factors as potential biomarkers of treatment response will be analysed.Methods:An evaluator-blinded RCT will be conducted in 42 children aged between 6 and 12 years. Before randomization, children will be stratified according to their House Functional Classification Scale, age and type of corticospinal tract wiring. A 2-week day-camp will be set up in which children receive intensive mCIMT therapy for 6 hours a day on 9 out of 11 consecutive days (54 h) including AOT or control condition (15 h). During AOT, these children watch video sequences showing goal-directed actions and subsequently execute the observed actions with the more impaired UL. The control group performs the same actions after watching computer games without human motion. The primary outcome measure will be the Assisting Hand Assessment. Secondary outcomes comprise clinical assessments across body function, activity and participation level of the International Classification of Function, Disability and Health. Furthermore, to quantitatively evaluate UL movement patterns, a three-dimensional motion analysis will be conducted.

81,Reorganization of the Action Observation Network and Sensory-Motor System in Children with Unilateral Cerebral Palsy: An fMRI Study.,"Little is known about the action observation network (AON) in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP). Using fMRI, we aimed to explore AON and sensory-motor network (SMN) in UCP children and compare them to typically developed (TD) children and analyse the relationship between AON (re-)organization and several neurophysiological and clinical measures. Twelve UCP children were assessed with clinical scales and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). For the fMRI study, they underwent a paradigm based on observation of complex and simple object-manipulation tasks executed by dominant and nondominant hand. Moreover, UCP and TD children carried out a further fMRI session to explore SMN in both an active motor and passive sensory task. AON in the UCP group showed higher lateralization, negatively related to performances on clinical scales, and had greater activation of unaffected hemisphere as compared to the bilateral representation in the TD group. In addition, a good congruence was found between bilateral or contralateral activation of AON and activation of SMN and TMS data. These findings indicate that our paradigm might be useful in exploring AON and the response to therapy in UCP subjects."
82,The Impact of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Affected and Unaffected Sides of a Child with Hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of neuro-navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with occupational therapy (OT) on gait impairment of a child (male, age: 13.2) with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP). The treatment included 4 days a week of rTMS sessions for 3 weeks and 4 days of rTMS and OT sessions per week for 3 weeks. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to evaluate corticospinal tract (CST) activities and H-reflex test was used to assess reflex hyper-excitability. Common clinical tests demonstrate the clinical status of the patient. Evaluations were performed in 4 time steps: baseline, 3 weeks after the beginning of the treatment, at the end of the treatment, and 1 month after the end of the treatment. The patient did not receive any specific treatment after the end of the treatment up to the follow up evaluations. The tests' results were compared between the affected and unaffected legs of the patient. Four parameters of the TMS test were calculated (motor evoked potential (MEP) latency, MEP peak-to-peak amplitude, cortical silent period (cSP), and stimulation intensity). These parameters were all improved for the affected side and cSP improved for the unaffected side, but MEP p-p amplitude and intensity got worse slightly for the unaffected side. Recruitment curves of H response and M-wave of the H-reflex test for both sides were obtained. Improvements could be seen after the treatment for both sides. Max H response on max M-wave (H/M) and H response latency got better after the treatment for both sides. Walking speed for self and fast velocity, timed up and go, and walking endurance improved during and after the treatment. All the improvements persisted after one month of the end of the treatment in the follow up evaluations. These findings indicate that rTMS combined with OT can have effective and long-lasting impact on neuromuscular impairments in spastic CP children."
83,The Effects of Low Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on White Matter Structural Connectivity in Children with Cerebral Palsy.,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive treatment technique for recovery of movement disorders by altering cortical plasticity. In this research, we studied the effects of low-frequency rTMS on white matter (WM) structural connectivity and clinical parameters in children with cerebral palsy (CP).,Four spastic hemiplegic CP children were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, at first, 1Hz rTMS treatment was performed 4 days/week for 3 weeks on two hemiplegia patients over a contralesional primary motor cortex (M1). Then, 1Hz rTMS treatment was performed 4 days/week for 3 weeks followed by a 30min occupational therapy (OT). In the control group, two CP children received sham rTMS for 3 weeks and then sham rTMS combined with OT for 3 weeks in the same schedule as the experimental group. Evaluations performed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and clinical measurements of gait performance before and after the treatment. Graph theoretical analysis was used to characterize topological changes of structural connectivity. Our findings demonstrate the 1Hz rTMS is effective in improving motor activity in spastic hemiplegic CP children, and is more effective when combined with OT."
84,Therapeutic Effects of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Corticospinal Tract Activities and Neuromuscular Properties in Children with Cerebral Palsy.,"The objective of this research was to study the therapeutic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on corticospinal tract (CST) activities, reflex hyper-excitability, muscle stiffness, and the clinical status of children with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP). Three children participated in this study. The treatment lasted for 6 weeks. Two of the patients, the experimental group, received rTMS therapy 4 days a week during the first 3 weeks, and then received typical occupational therapy (OT) after each rTMS session during the second 3 weeks. One patient, the control group, received the same treatment except that a sham coil was used. Each rTMS session lasted for 20 minutes and each OT session lasted for 45 minutes. We evaluated CST activities by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), reflex hyperexcitability by H-reflex response, and muscle stiffness by sonoelastography images. The tests were taken before and after the treatment. Major TMS parameters (i.e., motor evoked potential (MEP) latency, MEP p-p amplitude, cortical silent period (cSP), and intensity of pulse) for experimental patients were improved in comparison with the control patient. H response latency and max H response on max M-wave (H/M) were improved for the experimental group compared to the control group. Two parameters of texture analysis of the sonoelastography images (i.e., entropy and contrast) were improved for the experimental group. Clinical evaluations such as 10 meter walk test (10MWT), timed up and go (TUG), and 6 minute walk test (6MWT) were performed before and after the course of treatment and were improved for the experimental group compared to the control group. These results indicated that rTMS therapy can improve CST activities, reflexes, muscle stiffness, and walking capacity of spastic hemiplegic CP. Therefore, it can be considered as an effective therapeutic tool for enhancing neuromuscular abnormalities resulting from CP."
85,Neuromodulatory effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses on functional motor performances of spastic cerebral palsy children.,"Background:Neuromodulation is emerging as a new therapeutic field towards treatment of neurological disorders through advances in medical devices. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is one such neuromodulatory device that has received increasing interest as a tool for modulating cortical excitability that influence motor activity in both normal and diseased population. However, the therapeutic effect of rTMS varies depending on stimulation frequency, intensity, pulse trains, duration, etc. Our previous studies had already demonstrated that higher frequency of 10 Hz was effective in improving the motor activity of spastic CP patients.Objective:This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of different rTMS pulses on gross motor performance of spastic CP patients.Method:Thirty spastic CP patients were divided equally into three groups P1500, P2000 and P2500 with mean age (in years) 7.7 ± SD4.4, 6.8 ± SD5.3 and 7.2 ± SD5.1 respectively. Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) was employed as an outcome measure to assess the motor performance. Constant rTMS frequency of 10 Hz was delivered to each participant but the number of stimulation pulse varied according to the groups; which were 1500, 2000 and 2500 pulses for P1500, P2000 and P2500 group respectively. rTMS therapy of 15 minutes duration was followed by physical therapy of 30 minutes daily for 20 days.Result:Statistical analysis of pre versus post GMFM scores of different groups revealed significant result (p < .001) and the improvement in functional motor activity was 2.33% in P1500, 3.58% in P2000 and 5.17% in P2500 group.Interpretation:The result demonstrated modulatory effect of rTMS pulse by improving motor function of spastic CP patients.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; gross motor function measure (GMFM); neuromodulation; physical therapy; repetitive Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

86,Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation in Children With Unilateral Cerebral Palsy: A Protocol and Risk Mitigation Guide.,"Non-invasive brain stimulation has been increasingly investigated, mainly in adults, with the aims of influencing motor recovery after stroke. However, a consensus on safety and optimal study design has not been established in pediatrics. The low incidence of reported major adverse events in adults with and without clinical conditions has expedited the exploration of NIBS in children with paralleled purposes to influence motor skill development after neurological injury. Considering developmental variability in children, with or without a neurologic diagnosis, adult dosing and protocols may not be appropriate. The purpose of this paper is to present recommendations and tools for the prevention and mitigation of adverse events (AEs) during NIBS in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP). Our recommendations provide a framework for pediatric NIBS study design. The key components of this report on NIBS AEs are (a) a summary of related literature to provide the background evidence and (b) tools for anticipating and managing AEs from four international pediatric laboratories. These recommendations provide a preliminary guide for the assessment of safety and risk mitigation of NIBS in children with UCP. Consistent reporting of safety, feasibility, and tolerability will refine NIBS practice guidelines contributing to future clinical translations of NIBS.Keywords:cerebral palsy; children; non-invasive brain stimulation; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; risk; safety; transcranial direct current stimulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation.

87,Vagus nerve magnetic modulation facilitates dysphagia recovery in patients with stroke involving the brainstem - A proof of concept study.,"Background & aims:Stroke involving the brainstem (SBS) causes severe oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD). Research on the therapeutic efficacy of vagus nerve modulation (VNM) by using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in SBS patients with OD has been limited thus far. We aimed to assess the effect of VNM by using rTMS in improving swallowing function after SBS.Method:We conducted a sham-controlled, double-blinded, parallel pilot study in 28 SBS patients with OD randomly allocated to a real rTMS group (n = 13; TMSreal) or a sham group (n = 15; TMSsham). For VNM, 5-Hz rTMS was applied to the left mastoid in 10 sessions. We evaluated all patients for swallowing function before and after rTMS conditioning, assessed on the 8-point Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) through videofluoroscopy and the Australian Therapy Outcome Measures-Swallowing scale (AusTOMs). We measured the amplitude and latency of cricopharyngeal motor evoked potentials (CP-MEPs) as the neurophysiological parameters.Results:TMSreal exhibited significant improvement in all swallowing outcomes-neurophysiological, radiological, and functional-compared with TMSsham: We noted higher CP-MEP amplitude (p = 0.004), shorter CP-MEP latency (p = 0.004), a lower PAS score (p = 0.001), and a higher AusTOMs score (p < 0.001) following rTMS in TMSreal. Moreover, the neurophysiological improvements were significantly correlated with the functional outcomes (p < 0.05).Conclusions:Our results encourage the application of VNM by using rTMS for improving swallowing function after SBS. The immediate therapeutic effects suggest that this novel intervention can be an effective complementary therapy to traditional oropharyngeal rehabilitation.Clinical trial registration:URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

88,Interhemispheric motor interactions in hemiparetic children with perinatal stroke: Clinical correlates and effects of neuromodulation therapy.,"Objective:Brain stimulation and constraint therapy may enhance function after perinatal stroke but mechanisms are unknown. We characterized interhemispheric interactions (IHI) in hemiparetic children and explored their relationship to motor function and neuromodulation.Methods:Forty-five hemiparetic perinatal stroke subjects aged 6-19 years completed a clinical trial of repetitive-transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and constraint therapy. Paired-pulse TMS measured IHI in cases and normal controls. Suprathreshold conditioning stimuli preceded contralateral test stimuli bidirectionally: stroke to non-stroke (SNS) and non-stroke to stroke (NSS). Primary outcome was the interhemispheric ratio (IHR) between conditioned and test only MEP amplitudes X100 (<100 implied inhibition). Motor outcomes at baseline and post-intervention were compared to IHR.Results:Procedures were well tolerated. IHI occurred bidirectionally in controls. Eighteen stroke participants had complete data. IHR were increased in stroke participants in both directions. SNS IHR was >100 (facilitation) in 39% of measurements and correlated with better motor function. NSS IHR correlated with poorer motor function. Intervention-induced clinical change was not associated with IHR.Conclusions:Interhemispheric interactions are altered and related to clinical function, but not necessarily neuromodulation, in children with perinatal stroke.Significance:Adding interhemispheric interactions to evolving models of developmental plasticity following early injury may advance neuromodulation strategies.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; Interhemispheric inhibition; Neuromodulation; Perinatal stroke; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

89,Somatosensory Evoked Potentials and Central Motor Conduction Times in children with dystonia and their correlation with outcomes from Deep Brain Stimulation of the Globus pallidus internus.,"Objectives:To report Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs) and Central Motor Conduction Times (CMCT) in children with dystonia and to test the hypothesis that these parameters predict outcome from Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS).Methods:180 children with dystonia underwent assessment for Globus pallidus internus (GPi) DBS, mean age 10 years (range 2.5-19). CMCT to each limb was calculated using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Median and posterior tibial nerve SEPs were recorded over contralateral and midline centro-parietal scalp. Structural abnormalities were assessed with cranial MRI. One-year outcome from DBS was assessed as percentage improvement in Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS-m).Results:Abnormal CMCTs and SEPs were found in 19% and 47% of children respectively and were observed more frequently in secondary than primary dystonia. Of children proceeding to DBS, better outcome was seen in those with normal (n = 78/89) versus abnormal CMCT (n = 11/89) (p = 0.002) and those with normal (n = 35/51) versus abnormal SEPs (n = 16/51) (p = 0.001). These relationships were independent of dystonia aetiology and cranial MRI findings.Conclusions:CMCTs and SEPs provide objective evidence of motor and sensory pathway dysfunction in children with dystonia and relate to DBS outcome.Significance:CMCTs and SEPs can contribute to patient selection and counselling of families about potential benefit from neuromodulation for dystonia.Keywords:Central Motor Conduction Time; Children; Deep Brain Stimulation; Dystonia; Dystonic cerebral palsy; Secondary; Somatosensory Evoked Potentials.

90,Neurophysiological mechanisms and functional impact of mirror movements in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy.,"Children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (CP) often have mirror movements, i.e. involuntary imitations of unilateral voluntary movements of the contralateral upper extremity. The pathophysiology of mirror movements has been investigated in small and heterogeneous cohorts in the literature. Specific pathophysiology of mirror movements and their impact on upper extremity function require systematic investigation in larger and homogeneous cohorts of children with unilateral spastic CP. Here we review two possible neurophysiological mechanisms underlying mirror movements in children with CP and those with typical development: (1) an ipsilateral corticospinal tract projecting from the contralesional motor cortex (M1) to both upper extremities; (2) insufficient interhemispheric inhibition between the two M1s. We also discuss clinical implications of mirror movements in children with unilateral CP and suggest that a thorough examination of the relationship between the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of mirror movements is warranted. We suggest two premises: (1) the presence of mirror movements is indicative of an ipsilateral corticospinal tract reorganization; and (2) the corticospinal tract organization may affect patients' responses to certain treatment. If these premises are supported through future research, mirror movements should be clinically evaluated for patient selection to maximize benefits of therapy, hence promoting individualized medicine in this population.What this paper adds:Mirror movements may be indicative of the underlying corticospinal tract reorganization in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Future research will benefit from systematic investigations of the relationship between mirror movements and its pathophysiology. Mirror movements may be a potential biomarker for individualized medicine in children with unilateral spastic CP."
91,The Relationship Between Hand Function and Overlapping Motor Representations of the Hands in the Contralesional Hemisphere in Unilateral Spastic Cerebral Palsy.,"Background:In many children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (USCP), the corticospinal tract to the affected hand atypically originates in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the affected hand. Such ipsilateral connectivity is on average a predictor of poor hand function. However, there is high variability in hand function in these children, which might be explained by the complexity of motor representations of both hands in the contralesional hemisphere.Objective:To measure the link between hand function and the size and excitability of motor representations of both hands, and their overlap, in the contralesional hemisphere of children with USCP.Methods:We used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to measure the size and excitability of motor representations of both hands, and their overlap, in the contralesional hemisphere of 50 children with USCP. We correlated these measures with manual dexterity of the affected hand, bimanual performance, and mirror movement strength.Results:The main and novel findings were (1) the large overlap in contralesional motor representations of the 2 hands and (2) the moderate positive associations of the size and excitability of such shared-site representations with hand function. Such functional associations were not present for overall size and excitability of representations of the affected hand.Conclusions:Greater relative overlap of the affected hand representation with the less-affected hand representation within the contralesional hemisphere was associated with better hand function. This association suggests that overlapping representations might be adaptively ""yoked,"" such that cortical control of the child's less-affected hand supports that of the affected hand.Keywords:corticospinal tract; hand function; hemiparesis; transcranial magnetic stimulation.

92,Safety and preliminary efficacy of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation in MS-related fatigue.,"Objective:To conduct a randomized, sham-controlled phase I/IIa study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of deep brain H-coil repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the primary motor cortex (MC) in patients with MS with fatigue or depression (NCT01106365).Methods:Thirty-three patients with MS were recruited to undergo 18 consecutive rTMS sessions over 6 weeks, followed by follow-up (FU) assessments over 6 weeks. Patients were randomized to receive high-frequency stimulation of the left PFC, MC, or sham stimulation. Primary end point was the safety of stimulation. Preliminary efficacy was assessed based on changes in Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Beck Depression Inventory scores. Randomization allowed only analysis of preliminary efficacy for fatigue.Results:No serious adverse events were observed. Five patients terminated participation during treatment due to mild side effects. Treatment resulted in a significant median FSS decrease of 1.0 point (95%CI [0.45,1.65]), which was sustained during FU.Conclusions:H-coil rTMS is safe and well tolerated in patients with MS. The observed sustained reduction in fatigue after subthreshold MC stimulation warrants further investigation.Clinicaltrialsgov identifier:
NCT01106365.Classification of evidence:This study provides Class III evidence that rTMS of the prefrontal or primary MC is not associated with serious adverse effects, although this study is underpowered to state this with any precision."
93,Effect of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation of Motor Cortex in Cerebral Palsy: A Study Protocol.,"Purpose:To assess the best electrode position of transcranial direct current stimulation combined with treadmill training in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy.Methods:Thirty children with cerebral palsy were randomly allocated to 3 groups: (1) treadmill training combined with anodal electrode positioned over the primary motor cortex in the region of the dominant hemisphere and the cathode positioned in the supraorbital region contralateral to anode; (2) sham anodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the primary motor cortex and sham cathode over the contralateral supraorbital region combined with treadmill training; (3) treadmill training combined with the anodal electrode positioned over the primary motor cortex in the region of the injured hemisphere and the cathode positioned contralateral to anode over the primary motor cortex. Evaluations of gait, balance, quality of life, and electromyographic activity were performed.Discussion:This is the protocol for an intervention study investigating electrode position to achieve improved function."
94,Understanding the relationship between brain and upper limb function in children with unilateral motor impairments: A multimodal approach.,"Atypical brain development and early brain injury have profound and long lasting impact on the development, skill acquisition, and subsequent independence of a child. Heterogeneity is present at the brain level and at the motor level; particularly with respect to phenomena of bilateral activation and mirrored movements (MMs). In this multiple case study we consider the feasibility of using several modalities to explore the relationship between brain structure and/or activity and hand function: Electroencephalography (EEG), both structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI, fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), Electromyography (EMG) and hand function assessments.Methods:15 children with unilateral CP (ages: 9.4 ± 2.5 years) undertook hand function assessments and at least two additional neuroimaging and/or neurophysiological procedures: MRI/DTI/fMRI (n = 13), TMS (n = 11), and/or EEG/EMG (n = 8). During the fMRI scans and EEG measurements, a motor task was performed to study cortical motor control activity during simple hand movements. DTI tractography analysis was used to study the corpus-callosum (CC) and cortico-spinal tracts (CST). TMS was used to study cortico-spinal connectivity pattern.Results:Type and range of severity of brain injury was evident across all levels of manual ability with the highest radiological scores corresponded to children poorer manual ability. Evidence of MMs was found in 7 children, mostly detected when moving the affected hand, and not necessarily corresponding to bilateral brain activation. When moving the affected hand, bilateral brain activation was seen in 6/11 children while 3/11 demonstrated unilateral activation in the contralateral hemisphere, and one child demonstrated motor activation predominantly in the supplementary motor area (SMA). TMS revealed three types of connectivity patterns from the cortex to the affected hand: a contralateral (n = 3), an ipsilateral (n = 4) and a mixed (n = 1) connectivity pattern; again without clear association with MMs. No differences were found between children with and without MMs in lesion scores, motor fMRI laterality indices, CST diffusivity values, and upper limb function. In the genu, midbody, and splenium of the CC, higher fractional anisotropy values were found in children with MMs compared to children without MMs. The EEG data indicated a stronger mu-restoration above the contralateral hemisphere in 6/8 children and above the ipsilateral hemisphere in 2/8 children.Conclusion:The current results demonstrate benefits from the use of different modalities when studying upper-limb function in children with CP; not least to accommodate to the variations in tolerance and feasibility of implementation of the differing methods. These exposed multiple individual brain-reorganization patterns corresponding to different functional motor abilities. Additional research is warranted to understand the transactional influences of early brain injury, neuroplasticity and developmental and environmental factors on hand function in order to develop targeted interventions.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; EEG; MRI; Mirror movements; Motor; TMS.

95,Changes in spectroscopic biomarkers after transcranial direct current stimulation in children with perinatal stroke.,"Background:Perinatal stroke causes lifelong motor disability, affecting independence and quality of life. Non-invasive neuromodulation interventions such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with intensive therapy may improve motor function in adult stroke hemiparesis but is under-explored in children. Measuring cortical metabolites with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can inform cortical neurobiology in perinatal stroke but how these change with neuromodulation is yet to be explored.Methods:A double-blind, sham-controlled, randomized clinical trial tested whether tDCS could enhance intensive motor learning therapy in hemiparetic children. Ten days of customized, goal-directed therapy was paired with cathodal tDCS over contralesional primary motor cortex (M1, 20 min, 1.0 mA, 0.04 mA/cm2) or sham. Motor outcomes were assessed using validated measures. Neuronal metabolites in both M1s were measured before and after intervention using fMRI-guided short-echo 3T MRS.Results:Fifteen children [age(range) = 12.1(6.6-18.3) years] were studied. Motor performance improved in both groups and tDCS was associated with greater goal achievement. After cathodal tDCS, the non-lesioned M1 showed decreases in glutamate/glutamine and creatine while no metabolite changes occurred with sham tDCS. Lesioned M1 metabolite concentrations did not change post-intervention. Baseline function was highly correlated with lesioned M1 metabolite concentrations (N-acetyl-aspartate, choline, creatine, glutamate/glutamine). These correlations consistently increased in strength following intervention. Metabolite changes were not correlated with motor function change. Baseline lesioned M1 creatine and choline levels were associated with clinical response.Conclusions:MRS metabolite levels and changes may reflect mechanisms of tDCS-related M1 plasticity and response biomarkers in hemiparetic children with perinatal stroke undergoing intensive neurorehabilitation.Keywords:CIMT; Cerebral palsy; Constraint-induced movement therapy; Hemiparesis; MRI; MRS; Neuroimaging; Pediatric; Spectroscopy; tDCS.

97,The neurophysiology of paediatric movement disorders.,"Purpose of review:To demonstrate how neurophysiological tools have advanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of paediatric movement disorders, and of neuroplasticity in the developing brain.Recent findings:Delineation of corticospinal tract connectivity using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is being investigated as a potential biomarker for response to therapy. TMS measures of cortical excitability and neuroplasticity are also being used to investigate the effects of therapy, demonstrating neuroplastic changes that relate to functional improvements. Analyses of evoked potentials and event-related changes in the electroencephalogaphy spectral activity provide growing evidence for the important role of aberrant sensory processing in the pathophysiology of many different movement disorders. Neurophysiological findings demonstrate that children with clinically similar phenotypes may have differing underlying pathophysiology, which in turn may explain differential response to therapy. Neurophysiological parameters can act as biomarkers, providing a means to stratify individuals, and are well suited to provide biofeedback. They therefore have enormous potential to facilitate improvements to therapy.Summary:Although currently a small field, the role of neurophysiology in paediatric movement disorders is poised to expand, both fuelled by and contributing to the rapidly growing fields of neuro-rehabilitation and neuromodulation and the move towards a more individualized therapeutic approach."
98,Effect of sensory and motor connectivity on hand function in pediatric hemiplegia.,"Objective:We tested the hypothesis that somatosensory system injury would more strongly affect movement than motor system injury in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (USCP). This hypothesis was based on how somatosensory and corticospinal circuits adapt to injury during development; whereas the motor system can maintain connections to the impaired hand from the uninjured hemisphere, this does not occur in the somatosensory system. As a corollary, cortical injury strongly impairs sensory function, so we hypothesized that cortical lesions would impair hand function more than subcortical lesions.Methods:Twenty-four children with unilateral cerebral palsy had physiological and anatomical measures of the motor and somatosensory systems and lesion classification. Motor physiology was performed with transcranial magnetic stimulation and somatosensory physiology with vibration-evoked electroencephalographic potentials. Tractography of the corticospinal tract and the medial lemniscus was performed with diffusion tensor imaging, and lesions were classified by magnetic resonance imaging. Anatomical and physiological results were correlated with measures of hand function using 2 independent statistical methods.Results:Children with disruptions in the somatosensory connectivity and cortical lesions had the most severe upper extremity impairments, particularly somatosensory function. Motor system connectivity was significantly correlated with bimanual function, but not unimanual function or somatosensory function.Interpretation:Both sensory and motor connectivity impact hand function in children with USCP. Somatosensory connectivity could be an important target for recovery of hand function in children with USCP. Ann Neurol 2017;82:766-780."
99,Less-Affected Hand Function in Children With Hemiparetic Unilateral Cerebral Palsy: A Comparison Study With Typically Developing Peers.,"Background:Neurorehabilitation interventions in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP) target motor abilities in daily life yet deficits in hand skills persist. Limitations in the less-affected hand may affect overall bimanual hand skills.Objective:To compare hand function, by timed motor performance on the Jebsen-Taylor Test of Hand Function (JTTHF) and grip strength of children with UCP to children with typical development (CTD), aged 8 to 18 years old. Exploratory analyses compared hand function measures with regard to neurophysiological outcomes measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation and between group comparisons of hemispheric motor threshold.Methods:Baseline hand skills were evaluated in 47 children (21 UCP; 26 CTD). Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation testing assessed corticospinal tract and motor threshold.Results:The mean difference of the less-affected hand of children with UCP to the dominant hand of CTD on the JTTHF was 21.4 seconds (95% CI = 9.32-33.46, P = .001). The mean difference in grip strength was -30.8 N (95% CI = -61.9 to 0.31, P = .052). Resting motor thresholds between groups were not significant, but age was significantly associated with resting motor threshold ( P < .001; P = .001). Children with UCP ipsilateral pattern of motor representation demonstrated greater mean differences between hands than children with contralateral pattern of motor representation ( P < .001). All results were adjusted for age and sex.Conclusions:The less-affected hand in children with UCP underperformed the dominant hand of CTD. Limitations were greater in children with UCP ipsilateral motor pattern. Rehabilitation in the less-affected hand may be warranted. Bilateral hand function in future studies may help identify the optimal rehabilitation and neuromodulatory intervention.Keywords:cerebral palsy; children; neuroplasticity; noninvasive brain stimulation; rehabilitation; stroke.

100,Neural correlates of fatigue in multiple sclerosis: a combined neurophysiological and neuroimaging approach (R1).,"The present study is aimed at further exploring structural and functional correlates of fatigue in Relapsing- Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) patients by using a combined approach by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and a Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). The physiopathology of fatigue in MS is still poorly understood, although a variety of pathogenic mechanisms has been proposed. Our working hypothesis is that diffuse microstructural white matter damage may subtend the cortico-subcortical functional disconnection described in patients with MS and fatigue. We enrolled 30 RRMS patients (mean age 39±13; age range 24-63 years) with mild neurological impairment Expanded Disability Status Scale <3.5, divided into two groups on the basis of their fatigue severity scale (FSS) scoring (cutoff ≥ 4). All the patients underwent a neurological evaluation, a brain MRI acquisition (including DTI study) and a neurophysiological assessment by means of TMS in a pre-movement facilitation paradigm. Our data showed a significant mean diffusivity (MD) increase (p=0.036) in left thalamo-frontal reconstructions in the MS patients with fatigue compared to those classified as non-fatigued. Moreover, significant correlations were observed between FSS scale and MD as well as planar coefficient (CP) values extracted from frontal-thalamic connections bilaterally. Instead, the pre-movement facilitation showed a significant difference between the groups with particular regard to the Reaction Time- MEP50ms amplitude (p=0.03). Our work confirms that fatigue is associated with a disruption of brain networks involved in motor preparation processes, depending on several frontal-thalamic pathways. Such findings can have an important role when dealing with fatigue management in MS patients and could be eventually used as prognostic marker of MS course."
101,Transcranial direct current stimulation as a motor neurorehabilitation tool: an empirical review.,"The present review collects the most relevant empirical evidence available in the literature until date regarding the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the human motor function. tDCS in a non-invasive neurostimulation technique that delivers a weak current through the brain scalp altering the cortical excitability on the target brain area. The electrical current modulates the resting membrane potential of a variety of neuronal population (as pyramidal and gabaergic neurons); raising or dropping the firing rate up or down, depending on the nature of the electrode and the applied intensity. These local changes additionally have shown long-lasting effects, evidenced by its promotion of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Due to its easy and safe application and its neuromodulatory effects, tDCS has attracted a big attention in the motor neurorehabilitation field among the last years. Therefore, the present manuscript updates the knowledge available about the main concept of tDCS, its practical use, safety considerations, and its underlying mechanisms of action. Moreover, we will focus on the empirical data obtained by studies regarding the application of tDCS on the motor function of healthy and clinical population, comprising motor deficiencies of a variety of pathologies as Parkinson's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy, among others. Finally, we will discuss the main current issues and future directions of tDCS as a motor neurorehabilitation tool."
102,"Effects of a single session of transcranial direct current stimulation on upper limb movements in children with cerebral palsy: A randomized, sham-controlled study.","Introduction:Motor impairment in children with spastic hemiparetic cerebral palsy (CP) is generally more prominent in the affected upper limb, leading to limitations in hand function stemming from deficiencies in motor coordination and selective motor control as well as muscle weakness, slower execution of movements and deficient integration of sensory-motor information.Objective:Determine the effect of a single session of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with functional training on the spatiotemporal variables of upper arm movements in children with spastic hemiparesis.Method:A randomized, sham-controlled trial with a blinded evaluator was conducted involving 20 children with CP between 6 and 12 years of age. The spatiotemporal variables of the upper limbs were analyzed by comparing the results of Evaluation 1 (before stimulation) and Evaluation 2 (immediately after stimulation). The protocol consisted of a 20-minute session of functional training of the paretic upper limb combined with tDCS administered over the primary motor cortex of the hemisphere contralateral to the motor impairment at an intensity of 1 mA. The participants were randomly allocated to two groups: experimental group (anodal tDCS) and control group (sham tDCS).Results:Statistically significant (p < 0.05) reductions in total movement duration and returning movement duration were found in both the paretic and non-paretic limbs in the group submitted to active tDCS. No significant differences were found in the control group for any of the variables analyzed.Conclusion:A single session of anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex of the hemisphere ipsilateral to the brain lesion led to momentary motor improvements in both upper limbs of the children with spastic hemiparetic CP analyzed in the present study.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; hemiparesis; transcranial direct current stimulation.

103,Transient Changes in Brain Metabolites after Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Spastic Cerebral Palsy: A Pilot Study.,"Background:Muscle spasticity is a disability caused by damage to the pyramidal system. Standard treatments for spasticity include muscle stretching, antispastic medications, and tendon release surgeries, but treatment outcomes remain unsatisfactory. Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in patients with muscle spasticity is known to result in significant improvement in spastic tone (p < 0.001). However, the mechanism of action by which tDCS treatment affects spasticity remains unclear. This pilot study aimed to investigate the effect of anodal tDCS upon brain metabolites in the left basal ganglia and ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) in children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP).Materials and methods:This study consisted of three steps: a baseline evaluation, a treatment period, and a follow-up period. During the treatment period, patients were given 20 min of 1 mA anodal tDCS over the left M1 for five consecutive days. Outcomes were compared between pre- and immediate posttreatment in terms of brain metabolites, Tardieu scales, and the quality of upper extremity skills test.Results:Ten patients with spastic CP were enrolled. Following tDCS, there were significant increases in the ratio of N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) (p = 0.030), choline (Cho)/Cr (p = 0.043), and myoinositol (mI)/Cr (p = 0.035) in the basal ganglia. Moreover, increased glutamine-glutamate (Glx)/Cr ratio in the left M1 (p = 0.008) was found. In addition, we also observed improvements in the extent of spasticity and hand function (p = 0.028).Conclusion:Five consecutive days of anodal tDCS over the left M1 appeared statistically to reduce the degree of spasticity and increase NAA, Cho, mI, and Glx. Future research studies, involving a larger sample size of spastic CP patients undergoing tDCS is now warranted.Keywords:basal ganglia; brain metabolites; magnetic resonance spectroscopy; primary motor cortex; spastic cerebral palsy; transcranial direct current stimulation.

104,"Therapeutic effects of anti-gravity treadmill (AlterG) training on reflex hyper-excitability, corticospinal tract activities, and muscle stiffness in children with cerebral palsy.","We aimed to study therapeutic effects of antigravity treadmill (AlterG) training on reflex hyper-excitability, muscle stiffness, and corticospinal tract (CST) function in children with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP). Three children received AlterG training 3 days per week for 8 weeks as experimental group. Each session lasted 45 minutes. One child as control group received typical occupational therapy for the same amount of time. We evaluated hyper-excitability of lower limb muscles by H-reflex response. We quantified muscle stiffness by sonoelastography images of the affected muscles. We quantified CST activity by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We performed the evaluations before and after training for both groups. H response latency and maximum M-wave amplitude were improved in experimental group after training compared to control group. Two children of experimental group had TMS response. Major parameters of TMS (i.e. peak-to-peak amplitude of motor evoked potential (MEP), latency of MEP, cortical silent period, and intensity of pulse) improved for both of them. Three parameters of texture analysis of sonoelastography images were improved for experimental group (i.e. contrast, entropy, and shear wave velocity). These findings indicate that AlterG training can improve reflexes, muscle stiffness, and CST activity in children with spastic hemiplegic CP and can be considered as a therapeutic tool to improve neuromuscular abnormalities occurring secondary to CP."
105,Developmental profile of motor cortex transcallosal inhibition in children and adolescents.,"Transcallosal fibers facilitate interhemispheric networks involved in motor tasks. Despite their clinical relevance, interhemispheric motor control systems have not been completely defined in the developing brain. The objective of this study was to examine the developmental profile of transcallosal inhibition in healthy children and adolescents. Nineteen typically developing right-handed participants were recruited. Two transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigms assessed transcallosal inhibition: ipsilateral silent periods (iSP) and paired-pulse interhemispheric inhibition (IHI). TMS was applied to the motor hotspot of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. Resting motor threshold (RMT), iSP latency, duration and suppression strength, and paired-pulse IHI were measured from both hemispheres. The Purdue Pegboard Test assessed unimanual motor function. Hemispheric differences were evident for RMT and iSP latency and suppression strength, where the left hemisphere had a lower RMT, prolonged latency, and greater suppression strength. iSP duration showed hemispheric symmetry. RMT and iSP latency decreased with age, whereas iSP suppression strength increased. Girls showed shorter iSP latency. Children typically displayed IHI, although hemispheric differences were observed. iSP suppression strength was uniquely associated with IHI within individuals. iSP duration correlated with motor performance. TMS can characterize transcallosal inhibition in normal children and adolescents with effects of age, directionality, sex, and motor performance. Establishing this developmental profile of interhemispheric interactions may advance understanding and therapeutic strategies for pediatric motor disorders such as cerebral palsy.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Here we demonstrate that transcranial magnetic stimulation can characterize transcallosal inhibition in normal children and adolescents with effects of age, directionality, handedness, and motor performance. Interestingly, we also demonstrated sex effects, possibly related to the differing developmental profiles of boys and girls. Establishing this developmental profile of interhemispheric interactions may advance understanding and therapeutic strategies for pediatric motor disorders such as cerebral palsy.Keywords:TMS; pediatrics; transcallosal inhibition.

106,Motor Cortex Plasticity in Children With Spastic Cerebral Palsy: A Systematic Review.,"A review of the literature was performed to answer the following questions: Does motor cortex excitability correlate with motor function? Do motor cortex excitability and cortex activation change after a rehabilitation program that results in improvements in motor outcomes? Can the 10-20 electroencephalography (EEG) system be used to locate the primary motor cortex when employing transcranial direct current stimulation? Is there a bihemispheric imbalance in individuals with cerebral palsy similar to what is observed in stroke survivors? the authors found there is an adaptation in the geometry of motor areas and the cortical representation of movement is variable following a brain lesion. The 10-20 EEG system may not be the best option for locating the primary motor cortex and positioning electrodes for noninvasive brain stimulation in children with cerebral palsy.Keywords:cerebral palsy; child; motor cortex; transcranial direct current stimulation.

108,"The relationship of corticospinal excitability with pain, motor performance and disability in subjects with chronic wrist/hand pain.","There is a growing body of evidence of changes in corticospinal excitability associated with musculoskeletal disorders, however there is a lack of knowledge of how these changes relate to measures of pain, motor performance and disability. An exploratory study was performed utilizing Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to investigate differences in corticospinal excitability in the Abductor Pollicis Brevis (APB) between 15 pain-free subjects and 15 subjects with chronic wrist/hand pain and to determine how corticospinal excitability was associated with measures of pain (visual analog scale, AUSCAN™), hand motor performance (isometric and key pinch strength, Purdue Pegboard Test), disability (AUSCAN™), and spinal motoneuronal excitability. Input-output curves demonstrated increased corticospinal excitability of the APB in the affected hand of subjects with chronic pain (p<0.01). Changes in corticospinal excitability were significantly correlated with pain intensity (r=0.77), disability (r=0.58), and negatively correlated with motoneuronal excitability (r=-0.57). Corticospinal excitability in subjects with heterogeneous injuries of the wrist/hand was associated with disability and pain.Keywords:Disability; Input-output curve; Motor Evoked Potentials; Motor function; Musculoskeletal; Strength; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.

109,Spinal and corticospinal pathways are differently modulated when standing at the bottom and the top of a three-step staircase in young and older adults.,"Purpose:This study investigated the modulation of spinal (group Ia afferents) and corticospinal pathways when young (22.7 ± 1.3 years) and older adults (72.2 ± 7.9 years) stood at the bottom and at the top of a three-step staircase equipped with force platforms.Method:Changes in submaximal H-reflex amplitude (H 50) and slope of the H-reflex input-output relation (spinal pathway), and in amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEP) triggered by transcranial magnetic stimulation (corticospinal pathway) at two intensities (1.1× and 1.2× motor threshold) were recorded in soleus when subjects stood as steady as possible downstairs and upstairs. The centre of pressure (CoP) excursion was analyzed in the time and frequency domains in both conditions.Results:Regardless of age, the mean CoP velocity was greater when standing upstairs (11.1 ± 3.5 mm s-1) than downstairs (9.0 ± 2.3 mm s-1; p = 0.002). The CoP power spectral density (PSD) in the 0-0.5 Hz band was greater upstairs than downstairs (+18.4%; p = 0.03) whereas PSD in the 2-20Hz frequency band was lesser (-41%) upstairs than downstairs (p < 0.001), regardless of age. In both groups, the H 50 amplitude (-30.6%; p < 0.001) and slope of H-reflex input-output relation (-10.2%; p = 0.002) were lesser when standing upstairs than downstairs, whereas no significant difference was observed in MEP amplitude and silent period between balance conditions (p > 0.05).Conclusion:These results indicate a lower dependence on spinal pathway to control soleus motor neurones when standing upstairs than downstairs accompanied by a change in postural control. This suggests that healthy older adults preserved their ability to adjust postural control to environmental demands.Keywords:Ageing; Balance; H reflex; MEP; Staircase; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

110,Transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation Can Enhance Motor Learning in Children.,"This study aims to determine the effects of transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) on motor learning in healthy school-aged children. Safety, tolerability, and translation of effects to untrained tasks were also explored. We recruited 24 right-handed children for a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded trial to receive: right primary motor cortex (M1) 1 mA anodal (1A-tDCS), left M1 1 mA cathodal (1C-tDCS), left M1 2 mA cathodal tDCS (2C-tDCS), or sham tDCS over 3 consecutive days of motor task practice. Participants trained their left hand to perform the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT) during tDCS application. Right hand and bimanual PPT, the Jebsen-Taylor Test (JTT), and the Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT) were tested at baseline and post-training. All measures were retested 6 weeks later. Active tDCS montages enhanced motor learning compared with sham (all P < 0.002). Effects were sustained at 6 weeks. Effect sizes were large and comparable across montages: contralateral 1A-tDCS (Cohen's d = 2.58) and ipsilateral 1C-tDCS (3.44) and 2C-tDCS (2.76). Performance in the untrained hand PPT, bilateral JTT, and SRTT often improved with tDCS. tDCS was well-tolerated and safe with no adverse events. These first principles will advance the pairing of tDCS with therapy to enhance rehabilitation for disabled children such as those with cerebral palsy.Keywords:motor cortex; motor learning; noninvasive brain stimulation; pediatrics; tDCS.

111,The Mirror Illusion Increases Motor Cortex Excitability in Children With and Without Hemiparesis.,"Background:Mirror therapy provides a visual illusion of a normal moving limb by using the mirror reflection of the unaffected arm instead of viewing the paretic limb and is used in rehabilitation to improve hand function. Little is known about the mechanism underlying its effect in children with hemiparesis.Objective:To investigate the effect of the mirror illusion (MI) on the excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) in children and adolescents.Methods:Twelve patients with hemiparesis (10-20 years) and 8 typically developing subjects (8-17 years) participated. Corticospinal reorganization was classified as contralateral (projection from contralateral hemisphere to affected hand) or ipsilateral (projection from ipsilateral hemisphere to affected hand). M1 excitability of the hemisphere projecting to the affected (nondominant in typically developing subjects) hand was obtained during 2 different conditions using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Each condition (without/with mirror) consisted of a unimanual and a bimanual task. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles.Results:MEP amplitudes were significantly increased during the mirror condition ( P = .005) in typically developing subjects and in patients with contralateral reorganization. No significant effect of MI was found in subjects with ipsilateral reorganization. MI increased M1 excitability during active movements only. This increase was not correlated to hand function.Conclusion:MI increases the excitability of M1 in hemiparetic patients with contralateral corticospinal organization and in typically developing subjects. This finding provides neurophysiological evidence supporting the application of mirror therapy in selected children and adolescents with hemiparesis.Keywords:cerebral palsy; hemiplegia; mirror illusion; pediatric rehabilitation; transcranial magnetic stimulation.

112,Contralesional Corticomotor Neurophysiology in Hemiparetic Children With Perinatal Stroke.,"Background:Perinatal stroke causes most hemiparetic cerebral palsy. Ipsilateral connections from nonlesioned hemisphere to affected hand are common. The nonlesioned primary motor cortex (M1) determines function and is a potential therapeutic target but its neurophysiology is poorly understood.Objective:We aimed to characterize the neurophysiological properties of the nonlesioned M1 in children with perinatal stroke and their relationship to clinical function.Methods:Fifty-two participants with hemiparetic cerebral palsy and magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed perinatal stroke and 40 controls aged 8 to 18 years completed the same transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol. Single-pulse TMS to nonlesioned M1 determined rest and active motor thresholds (RMT/AMT), motor-evoked potential (MEP) latencies, and stimulus recruitment curves (SRC: 100%-150% RMT). Paired-pulse TMS evaluated short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). Ipsilateral (IP) participants (ipsilateral MEP ≥0.05 mV in ≥5/20 trials) were compared with contralateral MEP only, nonipsilateral (NI) participants. Assisting Hand and Melbourne assessments quantified clinical function.Results:Twenty-five IP were compared with 13 NI (n = 38, median age 12 years, 66% male). IP had lower motor function. SRC to unaffected hand were comparable between IP and NI while IP had smaller ipsilateral SRC. Ipsilateral MEP latencies were prolonged (23.5 ± 1.8 vs 22.2 ± 1.5 ms contra, P < .001). Contralateral SICI was different between IP (-42%) and NI (-20%). Ipsilateral SICI was reduced (-20%). Contralateral ICF was comparable between groups (+43%) and ipsilaterally (+43%). Measures correlated between contralateral and ipsilateral sides.Conclusion:Neurophysiology of nonlesioned M1 and its relationship to motor function is measureable in children with perinatal stroke. Correlation of excitability and intracortical circuitry measures between contralateral and ipsilateral sides suggests common control mechanisms.Keywords:contralesional; hemiparesis; perinatal; plasticity; stroke; transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

113,Transcranial direct current stimulation for children with perinatal stroke and hemiparesis.,"Objective:To determine whether the addition of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to intensive therapy increases motor function in children with perinatal stroke and hemiparetic cerebral palsy.Methods:This was a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Participants were recruited from a population-based cohort with MRI-classified unilateral perinatal stroke, age of 6 to 18 years, and disabling hemiparesis. All completed a goal-directed, peer-supported, 2-week after-school motor learning camp (32 hours of therapy). Participants were randomized 1:1 to 1 mA cathodal tDCS over the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) for the initial 20 minutes of daily therapy or sham. Primary subjective (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure [COPM]), objective (Assisting Hand Assessment [AHA]), safety, and secondary outcomes were measured at 1 week and 2 months after intervention. Analysis was by intention to treat.Results:Twenty-four participants were randomized (median age 11.8 ± 2.7 years, range 6.7-17.8). COPM performance and satisfaction scores doubled at 1 week with sustained gains at 2 months (p < 0.001). COPM scores increased more with tDCS compared to sham control (p = 0.004). AHA scores demonstrated only mild increases at both time points with no tDCS effects. Procedures were safe and well tolerated with no decrease in either arm function or serious adverse events.Conclusion:tDCS trials appear feasible and safe in hemiparetic children. Lack of change in objective motor function may reflect underdosing of therapy. Marked gains in subjective function with tDCS warrant further study.Clinicaltrialsgov identifier:
NCT02170285.Classification of evidence:This study provides Class II evidence that for children with perinatal stroke and hemiparetic cerebral palsy, the addition of tDCS to moderate-dose motor learning therapy does not significantly improve motor function as measured by the AHA."
114,Combined transcranial direct current stimulation and robotic upper limb therapy improves upper limb function in an adult with cerebral palsy.,"Background:Robotic therapy can improve upper limb function in hemiparesis. Excitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can prime brain motor circuits before therapy.Objective:We tested safety and efficacy of tDCS plus robotic therapy in an adult with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (USCP).Methods:In each of 36 sessions, anodal tDCS (2 mA, 20 min) was applied over the motor map of the affected hand. Immediately after tDCS, the participant completed robotic therapy, using the shoulder, elbow, and wrist (MIT Manus). The participant sat in a padded chair with affected arm abducted, forearm supported, and hand grasping the robot handle. The participant controlled the robot arm with his affected arm to move a cursor from the center of a circle to each of eight targets (960 movements). Motor function was tested before, after, and six months after therapy with the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) and Fugl-Meyer (FM).Results:Reaching accuracy on the robot task improved significantly after therapy. The WMFT and FM improved clinically meaningful amounts after therapy. The motor map of the affected hand expanded after therapy. Improvements were maintained six months after therapy.Conclusions:Combined tDCS and robotics safely improved upper limb function in an adult with USCP.Keywords:Neuromodulation; neuroplasticity; rehabilitation.

115,Advancing non-invasive neuromodulation clinical trials in children: Lessons from perinatal stroke.,"Applications of non-invasive brain stimulation including therapeutic neuromodulation are expanding at an alarming rate. Increasingly established scientific principles, including directional modulation of well-informed cortical targets, are advancing clinical trial development. However, high levels of disease burden coupled with zealous enthusiasm may be getting ahead of rational research and evidence. Experience is limited in the developing brain where additional issues must be considered. Properly designed and meticulously executed clinical trials are essential and required to advance and optimize the potential of non-invasive neuromodulation without risking the well-being of children and families. Perinatal stroke causes most hemiplegic cerebral palsy and, as a focal injury of defined timing in an otherwise healthy brain, is an ideal human model of developmental plasticity. Advanced models of how the motor systems of young brains develop following early stroke are affording novel windows of opportunity for neuromodulation clinical trials, possibly directing neuroplasticity toward better outcomes. Reviewing the principles of clinical trial design relevant to neuromodulation and using perinatal stroke as a model, this article reviews the current and future issues of advancing such trials in children.Keywords:Brain stimulation; Cerebral palsy; Clinical trials; Developmental plasticity; Neuroplasticity; Perinatal stroke; Transcranial direct current stimulation; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

116,Using diffusion tensor imaging to identify corticospinal tract projection patterns in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy.,"Aim:To determine whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be an independent assessment for identifying the corticospinal tract (CST) projecting from the more-affected motor cortex in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (CP).Method:Twenty children with unilateral spastic CP participated in this study (16 males, four females; mean age 9y 2mo [standard deviation (SD) 3y 2mo], Manual Ability Classification System [MACS] level I-III). We used DTI tractography to reconstruct the CST projecting from the more-affected motor cortex. We mapped the motor representation of the more-affected hand by stimulating the more- and the less-affected motor cortex measured with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We then verified the presence or absence of the contralateral CST by comparing the TMS map and DTI tractography. Fisher's exact test was used to determine the association between findings of TMS and DTI.Results:DTI tractography successfully identified the CST controlling the more-affected hand (sensitivity=82%, specificity=78%).Interpretation:Contralateral CST projecting from the lesioned motor cortex assessed by DTI is consistent with findings of TMS mapping. Since CST connectivity may be predictive of response to certain upper extremity treatments, DTI-identified CST connectivity may potentially be valuable for determining such connectivity where TMS is unavailable or inadvisable for children with seizures."

118,Modulation of physiological mirror activity with transcranial direct current stimulation over dorsal premotor cortex.,"Humans have a natural tendency towards symmetrical movements, which rely on a distributed cortical network that allows for complex unimanual movements. Studies on healthy humans using rTMS have shown that disruption of this network, and particularly the dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC), can result in increased physiological mirror movements. The aim of the present set of experiments was to further investigate the role of dPMC in restricting motor output to the contralateral hand and determine whether physiological mirror movements could be decreased in healthy individuals. Physiological mirror movements were assessed before and after transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over right and left dPMC in three conditions: bilateral, unilateral left and unilateral right stimulation. Mirror EMG activity was assessed immediately before, 0, 10 and 20 min after tDCS. Results show that physiological mirroring increased significantly in the hand ipsilateral to cathodal stimulation during bilateral stimulation of the dPMC, 10 and 20 min after stimulation compared to baseline. There was no significant modulation of physiological mirroring in the hand ipsilateral to anodal stimulation in the bilateral condition or following unilateral anodal or unilateral cathodal stimulation. The present data further implicate the dPMC in the control of unimanual hand movements and show that physiological mirroring can be increased but not decreased with dPMC tDCS.Keywords:bilateral stimulation; dorsal premotor cortex; mirror movements; motor control; transcranial direct current stimulation.

119,Neurophysiologic markers of primary motor cortex for laryngeal muscles and premotor cortex in caudal opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus investigated in motor speech disorder: a navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study.,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have so far reported the results of mapping the primary motor cortex (M1) for hand and tongue muscles in stuttering disorder. This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for locating the M1 for laryngeal muscle and premotor cortical area in the caudal opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus, corresponding to Broca's area in stuttering subjects by applying new methodology for mapping these motor speech areas. Sixteen stuttering and eleven control subjects underwent rTMS motor speech mapping using modified patterned rTMS. The subjects performed visual object naming task during rTMS applied to the (a) left M1 for laryngeal muscles for recording corticobulbar motor-evoked potentials (CoMEP) from cricothyroid muscle and (b) left premotor cortical area in the caudal opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus while recording long latency responses (LLR) from cricothyroid muscle. The latency of CoMEP in control subjects was 11.75 ± 2.07 ms and CoMEP amplitude was 294.47 ± 208.87 µV, and in stuttering subjects CoMEP latency was 12.13 ± 0.75 ms and 504.64 ± 487.93 µV CoMEP amplitude. The latency of LLR in control subjects was 52.8 ± 8.6 ms and 54.95 ± 4.86 in stuttering subjects. No significant differences were found in CoMEP latency, CoMEP amplitude, and LLR latency between stuttering and control-fluent speakers. These results indicate there are probably no differences in stuttering compared to controls in functional anatomy of the pathway used for transmission of information from premotor cortex to the M1 cortices for laryngeal muscle representation and from there via corticobulbar tract to laryngeal muscles.Keywords:Laryngeal muscles; Motor speech disorder; Premotor cortex; Primary motor cortex; Stuttering; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

120,Corticospinal Excitability in Children with Congenital Hemiparesis.,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used as an assessment or intervention to evaluate or influence brain activity in children with hemiparetic cerebral palsy (CP) commonly caused by perinatal stroke. This communication report analyzed data from two clinical trials using TMS to assess corticospinal excitability in children and young adults with hemiparetic CP. The results of this communication revealed a higher probability of finding a motor evoked potential (MEP) on the non-lesioned hemisphere compared to the lesioned hemisphere (p = 0.005). The resting motor threshold (RMT) was lower on the non-lesioned hemisphere than the lesioned hemisphere (p = 0.013). There was a significantly negative correlation between age and RMT (rs = -0.65, p = 0.003). This communication provides information regarding MEP responses, motor thresholds (MTs) and the association with age during TMS assessment in children with hemiparetic CP. Such findings contribute to the development of future pediatric studies in neuroplasticity and neuromodulation to influence motor function and recovery after perinatal stroke.Keywords:cerebral palsy; motor evoked potential; motor threshold; perinatal stroke; transcranial magnetic stimulation.

121,Skilled Bimanual Training Drives Motor Cortex Plasticity in Children With Unilateral Cerebral Palsy.,"Background Intensive bimanual therapy can improve hand function in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (USCP). We compared the effects of structured bimanual skill training versus unstructured bimanual practice on motor outcomes and motor map plasticity in children with USCP. Objective We hypothesized that structured skill training would produce greater motor map plasticity than unstructured practice. Methods Twenty children with USCP (average age 9.5; 12 males) received therapy in a day camp setting, 6 h/day, 5 days/week, for 3 weeks. In structured skill training (n = 10), children performed progressively more difficult movements and practiced functional goals. In unstructured practice (n = 10), children engaged in bimanual activities but did not practice skillful movements or functional goals. We used the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA), Jebsen-Taylor Test of Hand Function (JTTHF), and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) to measure hand function. We used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to map the representation of first dorsal interosseous and flexor carpi radialis muscles bilaterally. Results Both groups showed significant improvements in bimanual hand use (AHA; P < .05) and hand dexterity (JTTHF; P < .001). However, only the structured skill group showed increases in the size of the affected hand motor map and amplitudes of motor evoked potentials (P < .01). Most children who showed the most functional improvements (COPM) had the largest changes in map size. Conclusions These findings uncover a dichotomy of plasticity: the unstructured practice group improved hand function but did not show changes in motor maps. Skill training is important for driving motor cortex plasticity in children with USCP.Keywords:hemiplegia; neuroplasticity; pediatric; rehabilitation; transcranial magnetic stimulation.

Participants will be randomly allocated to two groups: (1) functional training of the paretic upper limb combined with anodic transcranial stimulation; (2) functional training of the paretic upper limb combined with sham transcranial stimulation. Evaluation will involve three-dimensional movement analysis and electromyography using the SMART-D 140® system (BTS Engineering) and the FREEEMG® system (BTS Engineering), the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test, to assess functional mobility, the Portable Device and Ashworth Scale, to measure movement resistance and spasticity, and the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory, to evaluate performance. Functional reach training of the paretic upper limb will include a range of manual activities using educational toys associated with an induced constraint of the non-paretic limb during the training. Training will be performed in five weekly 20-minute sessions for two weeks. Transcranial stimulation over the primary motor cortex will be performed during the training sessions at an intensity of 1 mA. Findings will be analyzed statistically considering a 5 % significance level (P ≤ 0.05).Discussion:This paper presents a detailed description of a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial designed to demonstrate the effects of combining transcranial direct current stimulation over the primary motor cortex and functional training of the paretic limb in children with cerebral palsy classified at level I, II, or III of the Manual Ability Classification System.

123,The correlation between transcranial magnetic stimulation parameters and neuromuscular properties in children with cerebral palsy.,"We studied the correlation between corticospinal signaling and neuromuscular properties in children with Cerebral Palsy (CP). Corticospinal signaling was evaluated using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Neuromuscular properties were quantified using Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex), sonoelastography, clinical measurements, and isokinetic measures. In particular, we determined the relationship between the TMS parameters of the ankle joint and the neuromuscular features of ankle extensors and flexors as well as popular clinical measures of gait speed, endurance, balance and mobility. Seventeen CP patients and twelve healthy control subjects were evaluated. Our findings showed that the motor evoked potential (MEP) latency of TMS was significantly longer in CP than in healthy subjects. The MEP-latency was significantly correlated with the H-reflex response (r=0.71, p-value=0.04) and isokinetic features; i.e. max acceleration extension time (r=0.5, p-value=0.005), and max flexion time in the cycle (r=0.5, p-value =0.002). No significant correlation was observed between MEP-latency and clinical measurements of gait and sonoelastography of ankle muscles. The results suggest that the changes in corticospinal signaling could contribute to muscle weakness and hyperexcitability of reflexes observed in children with CP."
124,Spared Primary Motor Cortex and The Presence of MEP in Cerebral Palsy Dictate the Responsiveness to tDCS during Gait Training.,"The current priority of investigations involving transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and neurorehabilitation is to identify biomarkers associated with the positive results of the interventions such that respondent and non-respondent patients can be identified in the early phases of treatment. The aims were to determine whether: (1) present motor evoked potential (MEP); and (2) injuries involving the primary motor cortex, are associated with tDCS-enhancement in functional outcome following gait training in children with cerebral palsy (CP). We reviewed the data from our parallel, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind studies. Fifty-six children with spastic CP received gait training (either treadmill training or virtual reality training) and tDCS (active or sham). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to identify clinical, neurophysiologic and neuroanatomic predictors associated with the responsiveness to treatment with tDCS. MEP presence during the initial evaluation and the subcortical injury were associated with positive effects in the functional results. The logistic regression revealed that present MEP was a significant predictor for the six-minute walk test (6MWT; p = 0.003) and gait speed (p = 0.028), whereas the subcortical injury was a significant predictor of gait kinematics (p = 0.013) and gross motor function (p = 0.021). In this preliminary study involving children with CP, two important prediction factors of good responses to anodal tDCS combined with gait training were identified. Apparently, MEP (integrity of the corticospinal tract) and subcortical location of the brain injury exerted different influences on aspects related to gait, such as velocity and kinematics.Keywords:cerebral palsy; gait training; motor evoked potential; neuromodulation; non-invasive brain stimulation.

125,"Does a Combination of Virtual Reality, Neuromodulation and Neuroimaging Provide a Comprehensive Platform for Neurorehabilitation? - A Narrative Review of the Literature.","In the last decade, virtual reality (VR) training has been used extensively in video games and military training to provide a sense of realism and environmental interaction to its users. More recently, VR training has been explored as a possible adjunct therapy for people with motor and mental health dysfunctions. The concept underlying VR therapy as a treatment for motor and cognitive dysfunction is to improve neuroplasticity of the brain by engaging users in multisensory training. In this review, we discuss the theoretical framework underlying the use of VR as a therapeutic intervention for neurorehabilitation and provide evidence for its use in treating motor and mental disorders such as cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, stroke, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and other related clinical areas. While this review provides some insights into the efficacy of VR in clinical rehabilitation and its complimentary use with neuroimaging (e.g., fNIRS and EEG) and neuromodulation (e.g., tDCS and rTMS), more research is needed to understand how different clinical conditions are affected by VR therapies (e.g., stimulus presentation, interactivity, control and types of VR). Future studies should consider large, longitudinal randomized controlled trials to determine the true potential of VR therapies in various clinical populations.Keywords:EEG; fNIRS; neuroplasticity; neurorehabilitation; tDCS; virtual reality therapy.

126,Brain stimulation and constraint for perinatal stroke hemiparesis: The PLASTIC CHAMPS Trial.,"Objective:To determine whether the addition of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and/or constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) to intensive therapy increases motor function in children with perinatal stroke and hemiparesis.Methods:A factorial-design, blinded, randomized controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov/NCT01189058) assessed rTMS and CIMT effects in hemiparetic children (aged 6-19 years) with MRI-confirmed perinatal stroke. All completed a 2-week, goal-directed, peer-supported motor learning camp randomized to daily rTMS, CIMT, both, or neither. Primary outcomes were the Assisting Hand Assessment and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure at baseline, and 1 week, 2 and 6 months postintervention. Outcome assessors were blinded to treatment. Interim safety analyses occurred after 12 and 24 participants. Intention-to-treat analysis examined treatment effects over time (linear mixed effects model).Results:All 45 participants completed the trial. Addition of rTMS, CIMT, or both doubled the chances of clinically significant improvement. Assisting Hand Assessment gains at 6 months were additive and largest with rTMS + CIMT (β coefficient = 5.54 [2.57-8.51], p = 0.0004). The camp alone produced large improvements in Canadian Occupational Performance Measure scores, maximal at 6 months (Cohen d = 1.6, p = 0.002). Quality-of-life scores improved. Interventions were well tolerated and safe with no decrease in function of either hand.Conclusions:Hemiparetic children participating in intensive, psychosocial rehabilitation programs can achieve sustained functional gains. Addition of CIMT and rTMS increases the chances of improvement.Classification of evidence:This study provides Class II evidence that combined rTMS and CIMT enhance therapy-induced functional motor gains in children with stroke-induced hemiparetic cerebral palsy."
127,Intracortical inhibition in the soleus muscle is reduced during the control of upright standing in both young and old adults.,"Purpose:In a previous study, we reported that a short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) decreases in old but not in young adults when standing on foam vs. a rigid surface. Here, we examined if such an age by task difficulty interaction in motor cortical excitability also occurs in easier standing tasks.Methods:Fourteen young (23 ± 2.7 years) and fourteen old (65 ± 4.1 years) adults received transcranial magnetic brain stimulation and peripheral nerve stimulation, while they stood with or without support on a force platform.Results:In the soleus, we found that SICI was lower in unsupported (35 % inhibition) vs. supported (50 %) standing (p = 0.007) but similar in young vs. old adults (p = 0.591). In the tibialis anterior, SICI was similar between conditions (p = 0.597) but lower in old (52 %) vs. young (72 %) adults (p = 0.030). Age and standing with or without support did not affect the Hoffmann reflex in the soleus.Conclusions:The current data suggest that the motor cortex is involved in standing control, and that its role becomes more prominent with an increase in task difficulty.Keywords:Aging; Balance; Peripheral nerve stimulation; Short-interval intracortical inhibition; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

128,Dynamic modulation of rTMS on functional connectivity and functional network connectivity to children with cerebral palsy: a case report.,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive treatment tool for the recovery of cerebral palsy (CP). This report describes the modulation effect of rTMS to functional connectivity, functional network connectivity, motor, and cognitive ability following treatment in a child with mild ataxia CP. After receiving 8 months of 0.5 Hz rTMS treatment over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the child showed a gradual improvement in motor and cognitive-related functional connectivity and functional network connectivity following treatment as well as improved motor, cognitive functions. These pilot results provide the first evidence of the efficiency of 0.5 Hz of rTMS on a child with CP. Further large sample studies are needed to verify and expand the present findings."
129,Increased cerebellar activation after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex in patients with multiple system atrophy.,"Background:Previous review reported that the high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the primary motor area (M1) of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients could alleviate their symptoms. This study aimed to investigate the effect of rTMS over the left M1 of patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA).Methods:Fifteen MSA patients were randomly assigned to receive a 10-session real (EP: group of experimental patients; n=7) or sham (CP: group of control patients; n=8) rTMS stimulation over two weeks. The overall experimental procedure consisted of two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions, before and after a 10-session rTMS treatment. A complex self-paced sequential tapping task was performed during fMRI scanning. In addition, 18 age and gender matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. Subjects from the HC group did not receive any rTMS treatment and they underwent fMRI examination only once. The primary end point was the motor score change of the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS-II) measured before and after the 5th and 10th session. Task-related activation was also compared among groups.Results:After active rTMS treatment, only patients of EP group significant improvement in UMSARS-II score. Compared to HC, MSA patients showed significant activation over similar brain areas except for the cerebellum. Increased activation was obtained in the bilateral cerebellum after rTMS treatment in the EP group. On the contrary, no increased activation was identified in the CP group.Conclusions:Our results highlight rTMS over M1 induced motor improvement in MSA patients that may be associated with increased activation in the cerebellum.Keywords:Multiple system atrophy (MSA); cerebellum; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS); unified multiple system atrophy rating scale (UMSARS).

130,Effect of r-TMS over standard therapy in decreasing muscle tone of spastic cerebral palsy patients.,"Spastic cerebral palsy (CP) is the one of most common neurological disorders occurring due to damage to the immature brain or any other brain lesion at the time of birth. To aid in making the life of the CP patient meaningful, several interventions such as medical, surgical and rehabilitation have been employed to date. Besides these, recently repetitive Transcranial magnetic stimulation (r-TMS) is a new found approach which is being employed for treating various neurological and psychological conditions. The aim of this study was to observe the effects of r-TMS on muscle spasticity in CP patients by stimulating the motor cortex area of the brain, which is responsible for muscle movements. In this study, 20 subjects diagnosed with CP were recruited and 10 each were placed in two groups, namely the research group (RG) (mean age, height and weight were 7.99 (SD = 4.66) years, 116.7 (SD = 23.57) cm and 21.40 (SD = 10.95) kg, respectively) and the control group (CG) (mean age, height and weight were 8.41 (SD = 4.32) years, 107.9 (SD = 26.33) cm, 21.40 (SD = 12.63) kg, respectively). r-TMS frequencies of 5 Hz and 10 Hz were administered for 15 min daily to patients in RG followed by standard therapy (ST) of 1 h duration daily for 20 days. Moreover, the patients in the control group (CG) were given only standard therapy (ST) of 1 h duration for 20 days. Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) was used as an outcome measure to determine the level of muscle spasticity. A pre- assessment of MAS score was performed on both RG and CG to determine the level of spasticity prior to starting therapy; and similarly post-assessment after 20 days was done to observe the changes post-therapy. Statistical analysis of pre vs post MAS scores showed that few muscles showed reduction in muscle tightness after administering only ST in the CG. On the contrary, the RG that underwent r-TMS therapy combined with ST showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in muscle tightness for all the muscles selected for the therapy.Keywords:Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (r-TMS); Upper Motor Neuron (UMN); motor cortex; muscle tone; spasticity.

131,Postural challenge affects motor cortical activity in young and old adults.,"When humans voluntarily activate a muscle, intracortical inhibition decreases. Such a decrease also occurs in the presence of a postural challenge and more so with increasing age. Here, we examined age-related changes in motor cortical activity during postural and non-postural contractions with varying levels of postural challenge. Fourteen young (age 22) and twelve old adults (age 70) performed three conditions: (1) voluntary contraction of the soleus muscle in sitting and (2) leaning forward while standing with and (3) without being supported. Subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to the soleus motor area suppressing ongoing EMG, as an index of motor cortical activity. The area of EMG suppression was ~60% smaller (p<0.05) in unsupported vs. supported leaning and sitting, with no difference between these latter two conditions (p>0.05). Even though in absolute terms young compared with old adults leaned farther (p=0.018), there was no age effect or an age by condition interaction in EMG suppression. Leaning closer to the maximum without support correlated with less EMG suppression (rho=-0.44, p=0.034). We conclude that the critical factor in modulating motor cortical activity was postural challenge and not contraction aim or posture. Age did not affect the motor control strategy as quantified by the modulation of motor cortical activity, but the modulation appeared at a lower task difficulty with increasing age.Keywords:Aging; Balance; Intracortical inhibition; Postural activation; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Voluntary activation.

132,Hand function assessment in the first years of life in unilateral cerebral palsy: Correlation with neuroimaging and cortico-spinal reorganization.,"Aim:The purpose of the present study was to correlate early hand function assessment during the first years of life with neuroimaging findings and the different patterns of cortico-motor reorganization in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP).Methods:We conducted a long prospective observational study, in which 17 children with UCP (8 left-sided hemiplegia; Manual Ability Classification System level 1-3) were first assessed at a mean age of 24 months (range 18-28), and followed up by means of the Besta Scale, a new standardized protocol assessing both unimanual and bimanual hand function. They also underwent Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function (MUUL) and single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) at a mean age of 10 years 5 months (range 9 y 1 m-12 y 8 m). Brain MRIs of all the 17 children were independently assessed and scored by two blinded observers, according to a defined protocol. Possible correlations between hand function at first assessment, neuroimaging and TMS data were analyzed.Results:Early hand function impairment significantly correlated with the extension of brain damage (ρ = -0.531, p = 0.028), number of involved areas (ρ = -0.608, p = 0.010), presence of radiological signs of cortico-spinal degeneration (ρ = -0.628, p = 0.007), and basal ganglia involvement (ρ = -0.485, p = 0.049). Additionally, higher hand function scores (i.e. better hand function) at first assessment significantly correlated with contralateral cortico-spinal projections, while lower scores significantly correlated with either mixed or ipsilateral cortico-spinal projections to the affected hand (χ(2)(2) = 11.418, p = 0.003; post-hoc tests: contralateral TMS group versus ipsilateral: Z = -2.943, p = 0.002 and contralateral TMS group versus mixed: Z = -2.775, p = 0.006).Conclusions:To our knowledge, this is the first study correlating hand function assessment in the first years of life, and its evolution over time, with neuroimaging and cortico-spinal projection patterns in children with UCP. These findings could contribute to an improved prediction of prognosis and a better delineation of therapeutic interventions in young children with UCP.Keywords:Brain lesions; Cortico-spinal projections; Hand function assessment; TMS; Unilateral cerebral palsy.

133,"Effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation combined with virtual reality for improving gait in children with spastic diparetic cerebral palsy: a pilot, randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial.","Objective:To compare the effects of anodal vs. sham transcranial direct current stimulation combined with virtual reality training for improving gait in children with cerebral palsy.Design:A pilot, randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial.Setting:Rehabilitation clinics.Subjects:A total of 20 children with diparesis owing to cerebral palsy.Interventions:The experimental group received anodal stimulation and the control group received sham stimulation over the primary motor cortex during virtual reality training. All patients underwent the same training programme involving a virtual reality (10 sessions). Evaluations were performed before and after the intervention as well as at the one-month follow-up and involved gait analysis, the Gross Motor Function Measure, the Pediatric Evaluation Disability Inventory and the determination of motor evoked potentials.Results:The experimental group had a better performance regarding gait velocity (experimental group: 0.63 ±0.17 to 0.85 ±0.11 m/s; control group: 0.73 ±0.15 to 0.61 ±0.15 m/s), cadence (experimental group: 97.4 ±14.1 to 116.8 ±8.7 steps/minute; control group: 92.6 ±10.4 to 99.7 ±9.7 steps/minute), gross motor function (dimension D experimental group: 59.7 ±12.8 to 74.9 ±13.8; control group: 58.9 ±10.4 to 69.4 ±9.3; dimension E experimental group: 59.0 ±10.9 to 79.1 ±8.5; control group: 60.3 ±10.1 to 67.4 ±11.4) and independent mobility (experimental group: 34.3 ±5.9 to 43.8 ±75.3; control group: 34.4 ±8.3 to 37.7 ±7.7). Moreover, transcranial direct current stimulation led to a significant increase in motor evoked potential (experimental group: 1.4 ±0.7 to 2.6 ±0.4; control group: 1.3 ±0.6 to 1.6 ±0.4).Conclusion:These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation combined with virtual reality training could be a useful tool for improving gait in children with cerebral palsy.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; gait; transcranial direct current stimulation; virtual reality therapy.

134,Synergistic effect of combined transcranial direct current stimulation/constraint-induced movement therapy in children and young adults with hemiparesis: study protocol.,"Background:Perinatal stroke occurs in more than 1 in 2,500 live births and resultant congenital hemiparesis necessitates investigation into interventions which may improve long-term function and decreased burden of care beyond current therapies ( http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/cp/data.html ). Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) is recognized as an effective hemiparesis rehabilitation intervention. Transcranial direct current stimulation as an adjunct treatment to CIMT may potentiate neuroplastic responses and improve motor function. The methodology of a clinical trial in children designed as a placebo-controlled, serial -session, non-invasive brain stimulation trial incorporating CIMT is described here. The primary hypotheses are 1) that no serious adverse events will occur in children receiving non-invasive brain stimulation and 2) that children in the stimulation intervention group will show significant improvements in hand motor function compared to children in the placebo stimulation control group.Methods/design:A randomized, controlled, double-blinded clinical trial. Twenty children and/or young adults (ages 8-21) with congenital hemiparesis, will be enrolled. The intervention group will receive ten 2-hour sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation combined with constraint-induced movement therapy and the control group will receive sham stimulation with CIMT. The primary outcome measure is safety assessment of transcranial direct current stimulation by physician evaluation, vital sign monitoring and symptom reports. Additionally, hand function will be evaluated using the Assisting Hand Assessment, grip strength and assessment of goals using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Neuroimaging will confirm diagnoses, corticospinal tract integrity and cortical activation. Motor cortical excitability will also be examined using transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques.Discussion:Combining non-invasive brain stimulation and CIMT interventions has the potential to improve motor function in children with congenital hemiparesis beyond each intervention independently. Such a combined intervention has the potential to benefit an individual throughout their lifetime.Trial registration:Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02250092 Registered 18 September 2014."
135,Addressing Neuroplastic Changes in Distributed Areas of the Nervous System Associated With Chronic Musculoskeletal Disorders.,"Present interventions utilized in musculoskeletal rehabilitation are guided, in large part, by a biomedical model where peripheral structural injury is believed to be the sole driver of the disorder. There are, however, neurophysiological changes across different areas of the peripheral and central nervous systems, including peripheral receptors, dorsal horn of the spinal cord, brain stem, sensorimotor cortical areas, and the mesolimbic and prefrontal areas associated with chronic musculoskeletal disorders, including chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis, and tendon injuries. These neurophysiological changes appear not only to be a consequence of peripheral structural injury but also to play a part in the pathophysiology of chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Neurophysiological changes are consistent with a biopsychosocial formulation reflecting the underlying mechanisms associated with sensory and motor findings, psychological traits, and perceptual changes associated with chronic musculoskeletal conditions. These changes, therefore, have important implications in the clinical manifestation, pathophysiology, and treatment of chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Musculoskeletal rehabilitation professionals have at their disposal tools to address these neuroplastic changes, including top-down cognitive-based interventions (eg, education, cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness meditation, motor imagery) and bottom-up physical interventions (eg, motor learning, peripheral sensory stimulation, manual therapy) that induce neuroplastic changes across distributed areas of the nervous system and affect outcomes in patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Furthermore, novel approaches such as the use of transcranial direct current stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be utilized to help renormalize neurological function. Comprehensive treatment addressing peripheral structural injury as well as neurophysiological changes occurring across distributed areas of the nervous system may help to improve outcomes in patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders."
136,Multiday Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Causes Clinically Insignificant Changes in Childhood Dystonia: A Pilot Study.,"Abnormal motor cortex activity is common in dystonia. Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation may alter cortical activity by decreasing excitability while anodal stimulation may increase motor learning. Previous results showed that a single session of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation can improve symptoms in childhood dystonia. Here we performed a 5-day, sham-controlled, double-blind, crossover study, where we measured tracking and muscle overflow in a myocontrol-based task. We applied cathodal and anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (2 mA, 9 minutes per day). For cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (7 participants), 3 subjects showed improvements whereas 2 showed worsening in overflow or tracking error. The effect size was small (about 1% of maximum voluntary contraction) and not clinically meaningful. For anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (6 participants), none showed improvement, whereas 5 showed worsening. Thus, multiday cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation reduced symptoms in some children but not to a clinically meaningful extent, whereas anodal transcranial direct current stimulation worsened symptoms. Our results do not support transcranial direct current stimulation as clinically viable for treating childhood dystonia.Keywords:cerebral palsy; dystonia; electromyogram; overflow; transcranial direct current stimulation.

137,"Capturing neuroplastic changes after bimanual intensive rehabilitation in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy: A combined DTI, TMS and fMRI pilot study.","Intensive rehabilitation interventions have been shown to be efficacious in improving upper extremity function in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (USCP). These interventions are based on motor learning principles and engage children in skillful movements. Improvements in upper extremity function are believed to be associated with neuroplastic changes. However, these neuroplastic changes have not been well-described in children with cerebral palsy, likely due to challenges in defining and implementing the optimal tools and tests in children. Here we documented the implementation of three different neurological assessments (diffusion tensor imaging-DTI, transcranial magnetic stimulation-TMS and functional magnetic resonance imaging-fMRI) before and after a bimanual intensive treatment (HABIT-ILE) in two children with USCP presenting differential corticospinal developmental reorganization (ipsilateral and contralateral). The aim of the study was to capture neurophysiological changes and to document the complementary relationship between these measures, the potential measurable changes and the feasibility of applying these techniques in children with USCP. Independent of cortical reorganization, both children showed increases in activation and size of the motor areas controlling the affected hand, quantified with different techniques. In addition, fMRI provided additional unexpected changes in the reward circuit while using the affected hand.Keywords:Bimanual training; Cerebral palsy; DTI; TMS; fMRI.

138,Evaluating developmental motor plasticity with paired afferent stimulation.,"Aim:Brain plasticity mechanisms are probably different in children but remain poorly understood. Paired afferent stimulation (PAS) combines peripheral sensory stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of primary motor cortex to induce rapid, reversible, topographically specific increases in primary motor cortex excitability suggestive of long-term potentiation in adults. Our aim was to determine frequency, characteristics, age effects, and reproducibility of PAS in school-age children.Method:Typically developing right-handed children (6-18y) were recruited. Median nerve stimulation was delivered 25ms before suprathreshold primary motor cortex stimulation (0.2Hz, 7.5min). Primary outcome was changed in the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) at five time points after PAS (0, 15, 30, 45, 75min) expressed as area under the curve. Reproducibility was evaluated. Secondary outcomes included stimulus response curves and safety/tolerability.Results:Of 28 children (20 males, mean age 12y), 64% demonstrated PAS effects (11 definite, seven probable). PAS effects were sustained across all time points to 75min (p=0.004). Stimulus response curve scores increased after PAS (n=9, p=0.02). PAS effect and age were not correlated. PAS was highly reproducible (p=0.925, r=0.283). Tolerability was favorable without adverse events.Interpretation:PAS effects are present and reproducible in children. Pediatric PAS paradigms appear safe and tolerable. PAS may provide insight into endogenous developmental plasticity, informing future studies in children with cerebral palsy and other motor disorders."
139,Noninvasive brain stimulation: the potential for use in the rehabilitation of pediatric acquired brain injury.,"Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) offers the potential to modulate neural activity and recovery after acquired brain injury. There are few studies of NIBS in children, but a survey of those studies might provide insight into the potential for NIBS to modulate motor rehabilitation, seizures, and behavior in children. We surveyed the published literature prior to July 2014 for articles pertaining to children and NIBS with a focus on case series or trials. We also reviewed selected articles involving adults to illustrate specific points where the literature in children is lacking. A limited number of articles suggest that NIBS can transiently improve motor function. The evidence for an effect on seizures is mixed. Two open-label studies reported improvement of mood in adolescents with depression. NIBS may serve as a tool for pediatric neurorehabilitation, but many gaps in our knowledge must be filled before NIBS can be adopted as a clinical intervention. To move forward, the field needs adequately powered trials that can answer these questions. Such trials will be challenging to perform, will likely require multicenter collaboration, and may need to adopt novel trial designs that have been used with rare disorders.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; Child; Rehabilitation; Stroke; Transcranial direct current stimulation; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

140,Theta burst stimulation to characterize changes in brain plasticity following mild traumatic brain injury: A proof-of-principle study.,"Purpose:Recent studies investigating the effects of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) suggest the presence of unbalanced excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms within primary motor cortex (M1). Whether these abnormalities are associated with impaired synaptic plasticity remains unknown.Methods:The effects of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) on transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were assessed on average two weeks and six weeks following mTBI in five individuals.Results:The procedure was well-tolerated by all participants. Continuous TBS failed to induce a significant reduction of MEP amplitudes two weeks after the injury, but response to cTBS normalized six weeks following injury, as a majority of patients became asymptomatic.Conclusions:These preliminary results suggest that cTBS can be used to assess M1 synaptic plasticity in subacute phase following mTBI and may provide insights into neurobiological substrates of symptoms and consequences of mTBI.Keywords:Traumatic brain injury; concussion; motor cortex; plasticity; transcranial magnetic stimulation.

141,Transcranial direct current stimulation during treadmill training in children with cerebral palsy: a randomized controlled double-blind clinical trial.,"Impaired gait constitutes an important functional limitation in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Treadmill training has achieved encouraging results regarding improvements in the gait pattern of this population. Moreover, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is believed to potentiate the results achieved during the motor rehabilitation process. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of the administration of tDCS during treadmill training on the gait pattern of children with spastic diparetic CP. A double-blind randomized controlled trial was carried out involving 24 children with CP allocated to either an experimental group (active anodal tDCS [1mA] over the primary motor cortex of the dominant hemisphere) or control group (placebo tDCS) during ten 20-min sessions of treadmill training. The experimental group exhibited improvements in temporal functional mobility, gait variables (spatiotemporal and kinematics variables). The results were maintained one month after the end of the intervention. There was a significant change in corticospinal excitability as compared to control group. In the present study, the administration of tDCS during treadmill training potentiated the effects of motor training in children with spastic diparetic CP.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; Functional mobility; Transcranial direct current stimulation; Treadmill training.

142,Noninvasive and painless magnetic stimulation of nerves improved brain motor function and mobility in a cerebral palsy case.,"Motor deficits in cerebral palsy disturb functional independence. This study tested whether noninvasive and painless repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation could improve motor function in a 7-year-old boy with spastic hemiparetic cerebral palsy. Stimulation was applied over different nerves of the lower limbs for 5 sessions. We measured the concurrent aftereffects of this intervention on ankle motor control, gait (walking velocity, stride length, cadence, cycle duration), and function of brain motor pathways. We observed a decrease of ankle plantar flexors resistance to stretch, an increase of active dorsiflexion range of movement, and improvements of corticospinal control of ankle dorsiflexors. Joint mobility changes were still present 15 days after the end of stimulation, when all gait parameters were also improved. Resistance to stretch was still lower than prestimulation values 45 days after the end of stimulation. This case illustrates the sustained effects of repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation on brain plasticity, motor function, and gait. It suggests a potential impact for physical rehabilitation in cerebral palsy.Keywords:Cerebral palsy; Gait; Muscle spasticity; Neuronal plasticity; Peripheral nerves; Rehabilitation; Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

143,Reduction of spasticity in cerebral palsy by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation.,"Objective:To evaluate the anti-spasticity effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in individuals with spastic cerebral palsy (CP).Material and method:Forty-six children and adolescents with cerebral palsy were randomly assigned to either active (1 mA anodal) or sham (placebo) tDCS over the left primary motor cortex (Ml) on five consecutive days. Both group also received routine physical therapy. Measures of spasticity and passive range of motion (PROM) were administered before treatment, immediately after treatment, and at 24- and 48-hours follow-up.Results:Participants assigned to active tDCS treatment evidenced significantly more pre- to immediately post-treatment reductions in spasticity than participants assigned to the sham (p = 0.004, p<O. 001l, andp = 0.004 for shoulder wrist, and fingers respectively) and these improvement in spasticity maintainedfor at least 48 hours for wrist joints (p = 0.023). There was only one participant in the active tDCS condition developed erythematous rash. However, all participants tolerated the tDCS well without any serious adverse events.Conclusion:Anodal tDCS appeared to reduce CP-relatedspasticity (but not PROM) in the short term. Researches examine the long term benefits of this intervention on spasticity are warranted."
144,Effect of a single session of transcranial direct-current stimulation on balance and spatiotemporal gait variables in children with cerebral palsy: A randomized sham-controlled study.,"Background:Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) has been widely studied with the aim of enhancing local synaptic efficacy and modulating the electrical activity of the cortex in patients with neurological disorders.Objective:The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of a single session of tDCS regarding immediate changes in spatiotemporal gait and oscillations of the center of pressure (30 seconds) in children with cerebral palsy (CP).Method:A randomized controlled trial with a blinded evaluator was conducted involving 20 children with CP between six and ten years of age. Gait and balance were evaluated three times: Evaluation 1 (before the stimulation), Evaluation 2 (immediately after stimulation), and Evaluation 3 (20 minutes after the stimulation). The protocol consisted of a 20-minute session of tDCS applied to the primary motor cortex at an intensity of 1 mA. The participants were randomly allocated to two groups: experimental group - anodal stimulation of the primary motor cortex; and control group - placebo transcranial stimulation.Results:Significant reductions were found in the experimental group regarding oscillations during standing in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions with eyes open and eyes closed in comparison with the control group (p<0.05). In the intra-group analysis, the experimental group exhibited significant improvements in gait velocity, cadence, and oscillation in the center of pressure during standing (p<0.05). No significant differences were found in the control group among the different evaluations.Conclusion:A single session of tDCS applied to the primary motor cortex promotes positive changes in static balance and gait velocity in children with cerebral palsy."
145,Effect of transcranial direct-current stimulation combined with treadmill training on balance and functional performance in children with cerebral palsy: a double-blind randomized controlled trial.,"Background:Cerebral palsy refers to permanent, mutable motor development disorders stemming from a primary brain lesion, causing secondary musculoskeletal problems and limitations in activities of daily living. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of gait training combined with transcranial direct-current stimulation over the primary motor cortex on balance and functional performance in children with cerebral palsy.Methods:A double-blind randomized controlled study was carried out with 24 children aged five to 12 years with cerebral palsy randomly allocated to two intervention groups (blocks of six and stratified based on GMFCS level (levels I-II or level III).The experimental group (12 children) was submitted to treadmill training and anodal stimulation of the primary motor cortex. The control group (12 children) was submitted to treadmill training and placebo transcranial direct-current stimulation. Training was performed in five weekly sessions for 2 weeks. Evaluations consisted of stabilometric analysis as well as the administration of the Pediatric Balance Scale and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory one week before the intervention, one week after the completion of the intervention and one month after the completion of the intervention. All patients and two examiners were blinded to the allocation of the children to the different groups.Results:The experimental group exhibited better results in comparison to the control group with regard to anteroposterior sway (eyes open and closed; p<0.05), mediolateral sway (eyes closed; p<0.05) and the Pediatric Balance Scale both one week and one month after the completion of the protocol.Conclusion:Gait training on a treadmill combined with anodal stimulation of the primary motor cortex led to improvements in static balance and functional performance in children with cerebral palsy.Trial registration:Ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/RBR-9B5DH7."
146,The contribution of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the diagnosis and in the management of dementia.,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is emerging as a promising tool to non-invasively assess specific cortical circuits in neurological diseases. A number of studies have reported the abnormalities in TMS assays of cortical function in dementias. A PubMed-based literature review on TMS studies targeting primary and secondary dementia has been conducted using the key words ""transcranial magnetic stimulation"" or ""motor cortex excitability"" and ""dementia"" or ""cognitive impairment"" or ""memory impairment"" or ""memory decline"". Cortical excitability is increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in vascular dementia (VaD), generally reduced in secondary dementias. Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), a measure of central cholinergic circuitry, is normal in VaD and in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but suppressed in AD. In mild cognitive impairment, abnormal SAI may predict the progression to AD. No change in cortical excitability has been observed in FTD, in Parkinson's dementia and in dementia with Lewy bodies. Short-interval intracortical inhibition and controlateral silent period (cSP), two measures of gabaergic cortical inhibition, are abnormal in most dementias associated with parkinsonian symptoms. Ipsilateral silent period (iSP), which is dependent on integrity of the corpus callosum is abnormal in AD. While single TMS measure owns low specificity, a panel of measures can support the clinical diagnosis, predict progression and possibly identify earlier the ""brain at risk"". In dementias, TMS can be also exploited to select and evaluate the responders to specific drugs and, it might become a rehabilitative tool, in the attempt to restore impaired brain plasticity.Keywords:Brain stimulation; Cognitive dysfunction; Cortical excitability; Differential diagnosis; Intracortical circuitry; Motor impairment; Neuromodulation.

147,Reactivity of sensorimotor oscillations is altered in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy: A magnetoencephalographic study.,"Cerebral palsy (CP) is characterized by difficulty in control of movement and posture due to brain damage during early development. In addition, tactile discrimination deficits are prevalent in CP. To study the function of somatosensory and motor systems in CP, we compared the reactivity of sensorimotor cortical oscillations to median nerve stimulation in 12 hemiplegic CP children vs. 12 typically developing children using magnetoencephalography. We also determined the primary cortical somatosensory and motor representation areas of the affected hand in the CP children using somatosensory-evoked magnetic fields and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation, respectively. We hypothesized that the reactivity of the sensorimotor oscillations in alpha (10 Hz) and beta (20 Hz) bands would be altered in CP and that the beta-band reactivity would depend on the individual pattern of motor representation. Accordingly, in children with CP, suppression and rebound of both oscillations after stimulation of the contralateral hand were smaller in the lesioned than intact hemisphere. Furthermore, in two of the three children with CP having ipsilateral motor representation, the beta- but not alpha-band modulations were absent in both hemispheres after affected hand stimulation suggesting abnormal sensorimotor network interactions in these individuals. The results are consistent with widespread alterations in information processing in the sensorimotor system and complement current understanding of sensorimotor network development after early brain insults. Precise knowledge of the functional sensorimotor network organization may be useful in tailoring individual rehabilitation for people with CP.Keywords:magnetoencephalography MEG; pediatric; somatosensory; transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS.

148,Upper limb function and cortical organization in youth with unilateral cerebral palsy.,"Aim:To explore the relationship between motor cortical and descending motor pathway reorganization, lesion type, and upper limb function in youth with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP).Methods:Twenty participants with unilateral CP (mean age 15 ± 3 years; 11 males) completed a range of upper limb functional measures. Structural MRI, diffusion-weighted, and functional MRI were conducted to determine type and extent of brain lesion, descending white matter integrity, and whole-brain activity during affected hand use. Single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (n = 12) was used to examine functional integrity of the corticospinal pathway as well as primary motor cortex intracortical and interhemispheric inhibition from motor-evoked potentials and silent periods.Results:Fractional anisotropy measures within the posterior limb of the internal capsule were a predictor of upper limb function (R (2) = 0.41, F = 11.3, p = 0.004). Participants with periventricular lesions tended to have better upper limb function [F(2, 17) = 42.48, p < 0.0001]. Five participants with evidence of cortical reorganization and functional ipsilateral projections to their affected hand had worse upper limb function. Deficits in intracortical and interhemispheric inhibitory mechanisms were found in participants with worse upper limb function (Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function: Mann Whitney p = 0.02).Conclusion:Neuroimaging and TMS can provide useful information related to hand function of individuals with unilateral CP and may have potential to assist as a predictive tool and/or guide rehabilitation.Keywords:cerebral palsy; cortical re-organization; hemiplegia; upper limb function.

149,Early intervention after perinatal stroke: opportunities and challenges.,"Perinatal stroke is the most common cause of hemiplegic cerebral palsy. No standardized early intervention exists despite evidence for a critical time window for activity-dependent plasticity to mould corticospinal tract development in the first few years of life. Intervention during this unique period of plasticity could mitigate the consequences of perinatal stroke to an extent not possible with later intervention, by preserving the normal pattern of development of descending motor pathways. This article outlines the broad range of approaches currently under investigation. Despite significant progress in this area, improved early detection and outcome prediction remain important goals."
150,Outcomes in spasticity after repetitive transcranial magnetic and transcranial direct current stimulations.,"Non-invasive brain stimulations mainly consist of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation exhibits satisfactory outcomes in improving multiple sclerosis, stroke, spinal cord injury and cerebral palsy-induced spasticity. By contrast, transcranial direct current stimulation has only been studied in post-stroke spasticity. To better validate the efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulations in improving the spasticity post-stroke, more prospective cohort studies involving large sample sizes are needed.Keywords:central nervous system; motor cortex; muscle spasticity; reviews; stroke; transcranial direct current stimulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation.

151,Is outcome of constraint-induced movement therapy in unilateral cerebral palsy dependent on corticomotor projection pattern and brain lesion characteristics?,"Aim:The aim of the study was to explore individual variations in outcome of hand function after constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) in relation to the organization of corticomotor projection and brain lesion characteristics in participants with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP).Method:Sixteen participants (eight males, eight females; mean age 13 y, [SD 2 y] range 10-16 y) with unilateral CP (nine right-sided; Manual Ability Classification System [MACS] level I, n=1; level II, n=15) who participated in a 2-week CIMT day camp (63 h) were included in the study. Various aspects of hand function were measured by the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT), the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA), and the Melbourne Assessment, both before and after the day camp. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to explore the corticomotor organization, and brain lesion characteristics were described by visual assessment of conventional structural magnetic resonance images.Results:At a group level, the training was associated with significant improvements in JTHFT (p=0.003) and AHA (p=0.046), but not in Melbourne Assessment scores. Improvements were found in all types of corticomotor projection patterns, i.e. contralateral, mixed, and ipsilateral. There was no relationship between functional improvement and brain lesion characteristics.Interpretation:Individuals with CP experience improved motor outcomes after CIMT, independent of corticomotor projection pattern and lesion characteristics."
152,Understanding of action-related and abstract verbs in comparison: a behavioral and TMS study.,"Does the comprehension of both action-related and abstract verbs rely on motor simulation? In a behavioral experiment, in which a semantic task was used, response times to hand-action-related verbs were briefer than those to abstract verbs and both decreased with repetition of presentation. In a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) experiment, single-pulse stimulation was randomly delivered over hand motor area of the left primary motor cortex to measure cortical-spinal excitability at 300 or 500 ms after verb presentation. Two blocks of trials were run. In each block, the same verbs were randomly presented. In the first block, stimulation induced an increase in motor evoked potentials only when TMS was applied 300 ms after action-related verb presentation. In the second block, no modulation of motor cortex was found according to type of verb and stimulation-delay. These results confirm that motor simulation can be used to understand action rather than abstract verbs. Moreover, they suggest that with repetition, the semantic processing for action verbs does not require activation of primary motor cortex anymore."
153,Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation in children with dystonia: a sham-controlled study.,"Increased motor cortex excitability is a common finding in dystonia, and transcranial direct current stimulation can reduce motor cortex excitability. In an earlier study, we found that cathodal direct-current stimulation decreased motor overflow for some children with dystonia. To investigate this observation further, we performed a sham-controlled, double-blind, crossover study of 14 children with dystonia. We found a significant reduction in overflow following real stimulation, when participants performed the experimental task with the hand contralateral to the cathode. While these results suggest that cathodal stimulation may help some children to reduce involuntary overflow, the size of the effect is small. Further research will need to investigate ways to increase the magnitude of the effect of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation.Keywords:child; dystonia; electromyogram; overflow; transcranial direct current stimulation.

154,Increased motor cortex excitability during motor imagery in brain-computer interface trained subjects.,"Background:Motor imagery (MI) is the mental performance of movement without muscle activity. It is generally accepted that MI and motor performance have similar physiological mechanisms.Purpose:To investigate the activity and excitability of cortical motor areas during MI in subjects who were previously trained with an MI-based brain-computer interface (BCI).Subjects and methods:Eleven healthy volunteers without neurological impairments (mean age, 36 years; range: 24-68 years) were either trained with an MI-based BCI (BCI-trained, n = 5) or received no BCI training (n = 6, controls). Subjects imagined grasping in a blocked paradigm task with alternating rest and task periods. For evaluating the activity and excitability of cortical motor areas we used functional MRI and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS).Results:fMRI revealed activation in Brodmann areas 3 and 6, the cerebellum, and the thalamus during MI in all subjects. The primary motor cortex was activated only in BCI-trained subjects. The associative zones of activation were larger in non-trained subjects. During MI, motor evoked potentials recorded from two of the three targeted muscles were significantly higher only in BCI-trained subjects. The motor threshold decreased (median = 17%) during MI, which was also observed only in BCI-trained subjects.Conclusion:Previous BCI training increased motor cortex excitability during MI. These data may help to improve BCI applications, including rehabilitation of patients with cerebral palsy.Keywords:brain-computer interface; functional MRI; motor imagery; navigated TMS; neurorehabilitation.

155,Effect of transcranial direct current stimulation combined with gait and mobility training on functionality in children with cerebral palsy: study protocol for a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial.,"Background:The project proposes three innovative intervention techniques (treadmill training, mobility training with virtual reality and transcranial direct current stimulation that can be safely administered to children with cerebral palsy. The combination of transcranial stimulation and physical therapy resources will provide the training of a specific task with multiple rhythmic repetitions of the phases of the gait cycle, providing rich sensory stimuli with a modified excitability threshold of the primary motor cortex to enhance local synaptic efficacy and potentiate motor learning.Methods/design:A prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled, analytical, clinical trial will be carried out.Eligible participants will be children with cerebral palsy classified on levels I, II and III of the Gross Motor Function Classification System between four and ten years of age. The participants will be randomly allocated to four groups: 1) gait training on a treadmill with placebo transcranial stimulation; 2) gait training on a treadmill with active transcranial stimulation; 3) mobility training with virtual reality and placebo transcranial stimulation; 4) mobility training with virtual reality and active transcranial stimulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation will be applied with the anodal electrode positioned in the region of the dominant hemisphere over C3, corresponding to the primary motor cortex, and the cathode positioned in the supraorbital region contralateral to the anode. A 1 mA current will be applied for 20 minutes. Treadmill training and mobility training with virtual reality will be performed in 30-minute sessions five times a week for two weeks (total of 10 sessions). Evaluations will be performed on four occasions: one week prior to the intervention; one week following the intervention; one month after the end of the intervention;and 3 months after the end of the intervention. The evaluations will involve three-dimensional gait analysis, analysis of cortex excitability (motor threshold and motor evoked potential), Six-Minute Walk Test, Timed Up-and-Go Test, Pediatric Evaluation Disability Inventory, Gross Motor Function Measure, Berg Balance Scale, stabilometry, maximum respiratory pressure and an effort test.Discussion:This paper offers a detailed description of a prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled, analytical, clinical trial aimed at demonstrating the effect combining transcranial stimulation with treadmill and mobility training on functionality and primary cortex excitability in children with Cerebral Palsy classified on Gross Motor Function Classification System levels I, II and III. The results will be published and will contribute to evidence regarding the use of treadmill training on this population.Trial registration:ReBEC RBR-9B5DH7."
156,Neonatal neuroimaging predicts recruitment of contralesional corticospinal tracts following perinatal brain injury.,"Aim:Unilateral perinatal brain injury may result in recruitment of ipsilateral projections originating in the unaffected hemisphere and development of unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (USCP). The aim of this study was to assess the predictive value of neonatal neuroimaging following perinatal brain injury for recruitment of ipsilateral corticospinal tracts.Method:Neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cranial ultrasound scans of 37 children (20 males, 17 females; median [range] gestational age 36 wks(+4) [26(+6) -42wks(+5) ] and birthweight 2312 g ([770-5230g]) with unilateral perinatal arterial ischaemic stroke (n=23) or periventricular haemorrhagic infarction (n=14) were reviewed and scored for involvement of the corticospinal trajectory. Hand function was assessed using the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was performed (age range 7y 4mo-18y and 7mo) to determine the type of cortical motor organization (normal, mixed or ipsilateral). Neuroimaging scores were used to predict TMS patterns.Results:Eighteen children developed USCP with ipsilateral corticospinal tract projections in 13 children (eight mixed, five ipsilateral). AHA scores decreased with increased ipsilateral projections. Asymmetry of the corticospinal tracts seen on neonatal MRI was predictive of development of USCP and recruitment of ipsilateral tracts (positive and negative predictive value of 73% and 91%).Interpretation:Neonatal neuroimaging can predict recruitment of ipsilateral corticospinal tracts. Early knowledge of the expected pattern of cortical motor organization will allow early identification of children eligible for early therapy."
157,Can noninvasive brain stimulation measure and modulate developmental plasticity to improve function in stroke-induced cerebral palsy?,"The permanent nature of motor deficits is a consistent cornerstone of cerebral palsy definitions. Such pessimism is disheartening to children, families, and researchers alike and may no longer be appropriate for it ignores the fantastic plastic potential of the developing brain. Perinatal stroke is presented as the ideal human model of developmental neuroplasticity following distinct, well-defined, focal perinatal brain injury. Elegant animal models are merging with human applied technology methods, including noninvasive brain stimulation for increasingly sophisticated models of plastic motor development following perinatal stroke. In this article, how potential central therapeutic targets are identified and potentially modulated to enhance motor function within these models is discussed. Also, future directions and emerging clinical trials are reviewed."
158,Training to enhance walking in children with cerebral palsy: are we missing the window of opportunity?,"The objective of this paper is to (1) identify from the literature a potential critical period for the maturation of the corticospinal tract (CST) and (2) report pilot data on an intensive, activity-based therapy applied during this period, in children with lesions to the CST. The best estimate of the CST critical period for the legs is when the child is younger than 2 years of age. Previous interventions for walking in children with CST damage were mainly applied after this age. Our preliminary results with training children younger than 2 years showed improvements in walking that exceeded all previous reports. Further, we refined techniques for measuring motor and sensory pathways to and from the legs, so that changes can be measured at this young age. Previous activity-based therapies may have been applied too late in development. A randomized controlled trial is now underway to determine if intensive leg therapy improves the outcome of children with early stroke."
159,Efficacy of coupling inhibitory and facilitatory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to enhance motor recovery in hemiplegic stroke patients.,"Background and purpose:Although there has been extensive research on the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to improve patients' motor performance after experiencing chronic stroke, explicit findings on the coupling of different rTMS protocols are meager. We designed this sham-controlled randomized study to investigate the potential for a consecutive suppressive-facilitatory TMS protocol to improve motor outcomes after chronic stroke.Methods:Fifty-four chronic hemiplegic stroke patients were allocated across 4 groups to undergo 20 daily sessions of (1) 1 Hz rTMS over the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) and then intermittent theta burst stimulation over the ipsilesional M1 (group A); (2) contralesional sham stimulation and then ipsilesional real intermittent theta burst stimulation (group B); (3) contralesional real 1 Hz rTMS and then ipsilesional sham stimulation (group C); or (4) bilateral sham-control procedures (group D). We tested cortical excitability and motor activity assessments at the baseline, postpriming rTMS, and postconsequent rTMS periods.Results:At post, group A showed greater muscle strength, Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Wolf Motor Function test, and reaction time improvement in comparison with group B (P<0.001≈0.003) and group C (P=0.001≈0.003). Correlation analyses in group A revealed a close relation between contralesional map area decrement and Wolf Motor Function test gain (P=0.005; r=-0.75), and also revealed ipsilesional map area increment and reaction time decrement (P=0.02; r=-0.87). We detected no such relations in the other 3 groups.Conclusions:Our clinical trials established an extended timeframe during which conditioning could be safely continued and produced more favorable outcomes in facilitating motor performance and ameliorating interhemispheric imbalance than those obtained from single-course rTMS modulation alone."
160,[Effect of infra-low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation on motor function in children with spastic cerebral palsy].,"Objective:To study the therapeutic effects of infra-low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation in children with spastic cerebral palsy.Methods:Seventy-five children with spastic cerebral palsy were randomly divided into two groups: control (n=33) and treatment groups (n=42). The treatment group accepted infra-low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation besides conventional comprehensive rehabilitation therapy. The control group only accepted conventional comprehensive rehabilitation therapy. Motor functions were assessed by gross motor function measure (GMFM) and fine motor function measure (FMFM) at one and three months after treatment.Results:Improvement in the ability to sit in the treatment was better than in the control group at one month after treatment (P<0.05). Improvement in the ability to sit, crawl and kneel, total score of GMFM, and improvement of joint active ability of limbs, grasping ability and operating ability in the treatment group were better than the control group at three months after treatment (P<0.05).Conclusions:Infra-low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation can effectively improve motor function in children with spastic cerebral palsy."
161,Modeling developmental plasticity after perinatal stroke: defining central therapeutic targets in cerebral palsy.,"Perinatal stroke is presented as the ideal human model of developmental neuroplasticity. The precise timing, mechanisms, and locations of specific perinatal stroke diseases provide common examples of well defined, focal, perinatal brain injuries. Motor disability (hemiparetic cerebral palsy) constitutes the primary adverse outcome and the focus of models explaining how motor systems develop in health and after early injury. Combining basic science animal work with human applied technology (functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and transcranial magnetic stimulation), a model of plastic motor development after perinatal stroke is presented. Potential central therapeutic targets are revealed. The means to measure and modulate these targets, including evidence-based rehabilitation therapies and noninvasive brain stimulation, are suggested. Implications for clinical trials and future directions are discussed."
162,Updates in the treatment of spasticity associated with cerebral palsy.,"Spasticity affects up to 80 % of patients with cerebral palsy (CP) and often plays a significant role in limiting the child's ability to function and participate in daily activities. The treatment of spasticity involves a multifaceted approach that includes pharmacological treatment with antispasmodics, physical therapy to maintain range of motion and prevent contractures, as well as a variety of orthopedic and neurosurgical interventions. Pharmacological agents currently used in clinical practice to treat spasticity in children have existed for almost two decades and continue to be used despite lack of solid evidence for their efficacy. Studies detailing safety profiles and optimal dosing in the pediatric population are greatly warranted. Intramuscular injection of botulinum neurotoxin is becoming increasingly popular for the treatment of segmental spasticity and current literature suggests it is safe and effective (Level A). Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are emerging as effective interventions in improving motor function in hemiplegic CP. However, the role of these as of yet >interventions in reducing spasticity remains to be clarified."
163,Reduced corticomotor excitability and motor skills development in children born preterm.,"The mechanisms underlying the altered neurodevelopment commonly experienced by children born preterm, but without brain lesions, remain unknown. While individuals born the earliest are at most risk, late preterm children also experience significant motor, cognitive and behavioural dysfunction from school age, and reduced income and educational attainment in adulthood. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional assessments to examine corticomotor development in 151 children without cerebral palsy, aged 10-13 years and born after gestations of 25-41 completed weeks. We hypothesized that motor cortex and corticospinal development are altered in preterm children, which underpins at least some of their motor dysfunction. We report for the first time that every week of reduced gestation is associated with a reduction in corticomotor excitability that remains evident in late childhood. This reduced excitability was associated with poorer motor skill development, particularly manual dexterity. However, child adiposity, sex and socio-economic factors regarding the child's home environment soon after birth were also powerful influences on development of motor skills. Preterm birth was also associated with reduced left hemisphere lateralization, but without increasing the likelihood of being left handed per se. These corticomotor findings have implications for normal motor development, but also raise questions regarding possible longer term consequences of preterm birth on motor function."
164,Motor cortical functional geometry in cerebral palsy and its relationship to disability.,"Objective:To investigate motor cortical map patterns in children with diplegic and hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP), and the relationships between motor cortical geometry and motor function in CP.Methods:Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to map motor cortical representations of the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in 13 children with CP (age 9-16 years, 6 males.) The Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and Melbourne upper extremity function were used to quantify motor ability.Results:In the hemiplegic participants (N = 7), the affected (right) FDI cortical representation was mapped on the ipsilateral (N = 4), contralateral (N = 2), or bilateral (N = 1) cortex. Participants with diplegia (N = 6) showed either bilateral (N = 2) or contralateral (N = 4) cortical hand maps. The FDI and TA motor map center-of-gravity mediolateral location ranged from 2-8 cm and 3-6 cm from the midline, respectively. Among diplegics, more lateral FDI representation locations were associated with lower Melbourne scores, i.e. worse hand motor function (Spearman's rho = -0.841, p = 0.036).Conclusions:Abnormalities in TMS-derived motor maps cut across the clinical classifications of hemiplegic and diplegic CP. The lateralization of the upper and lower extremity motor representation demonstrates reorganization after insults to the affected hemispheres of both diplegic and hemiplegic children.Significance:The current study is a step towards defining the relationship between changes in motor maps and functional impairments in CP. These results suggest the need for further work to develop improved classification schemes that integrate clinical, radiologic, and neurophysiologic measures in CP."
165,Subthalamic deep brain stimulation modulates small fiber-dependent sensory thresholds in Parkinson's disease.,"The effects of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus on nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) rarely have been investigated. Among these, sensory disturbances, including chronic pain (CP), are frequent in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes induced by deep brain stimulation in the perception of sensory stimuli, either noxious or innocuous, mediated by small or large nerve fibers. Sensory detection and pain thresholds were assessed in 25 PD patients all in the off-medication condition with the stimulator turned on or off (on- and off-stimulation conditions, respectively). The relationship between the changes induced by surgery on quantitative sensory testing, spontaneous CP, and motor abilities were studied. Quantitative sensory test results obtained in PD patients were compared with those of age-matched healthy subjects. Chronic pain was present in 72% of patients before vs 36% after surgery (P=.019). Compared with healthy subjects, PD patients had an increased sensitivity to innocuous thermal stimuli and mechanical pain, but a reduced sensitivity to innocuous mechanical stimuli. In addition, they had an increased pain rating when painful thermal stimuli were applied, particularly in the off-stimulation condition. In the on-stimulation condition, there was an increased sensitivity to innocuous thermal stimuli but a reduced sensitivity to mechanical or thermal pain. Pain provoked by thermal stimuli was reduced when the stimulator was turned on. Motor improvement positively correlated with changes in warm detection and heat pain thresholds. Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation contributes to relieve pain associated with PD and specifically modulates small fiber-mediated sensations."
166,Care for child development: basic science rationale and effects of interventions.,"The past few years have witnessed increasing interest in devising programs to enhance early childhood development. We review current understandings of brain development, recent advances in this field, and their implications for clinical interventions. An expanding body of basic science laboratory data demonstrates that several interventions, including environmental enrichment, level of parental interaction, erythropoietin, antidepressants, transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, hypothermia, nutritional supplements, and stem cells, can enhance cerebral plasticity. Emerging clinical data, using functional magnetic resonance imaging and clinical evaluations, also support the hypothesis that clinical interventions can increase the developmental potential of children, rather than merely allowing the child to achieve an already predetermined potential. Such interventions include early developmental enrichment programs, which have improved cognitive function; high-energy and high-protein diets, which have increased brain growth in infants with perinatal brain damage; constraint-induced movement therapy, which has improved motor function in patients with stroke, cerebral palsy, and cerebral hemispherectomy; and transcranial magnetic stimulation, which has improved motor function in stroke patients."
167,Neuromuscular electrical stimulation has a global effect on corticospinal excitability for leg muscles and a focused effect for hand muscles.,"The afferent volley generated during neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) can increase the excitability of human corticospinal (CS) pathways to muscles of the leg and hand. Over time, such increases can strengthen CS pathways damaged by injury or disease and result in enduring improvements in function. There is some evidence that NMES affects CS excitability differently for muscles of the leg and hand, although a direct comparison has not been conducted. Thus, the present experiments were designed to compare the strength and specificity of NMES-induced changes in CS excitability for muscles of the leg and hand. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) For muscles innervated by the stimulated nerve (target muscles), CS excitability will increase more for the hand than for the leg. (2) For muscles not innervated by the stimulated nerve (non-target muscles), CS excitability will increase for muscles of the leg but not muscles of the hand. NMES was delivered over the common peroneal (CP) nerve in the leg or the median nerve at the wrist using a 1-ms pulse width in a 20 s on, 20 s off cycle for 40 min. The intensity was set to evoke an M-wave that was ~15% of the maximal M-wave in the target muscle: tibialis anterior (TA) in the leg and abductor pollicis brevis (APB) in the hand. Ten motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the target muscles and from 2 non-target muscles of each limb using transcranial magnetic stimulation delivered over the ""hotspot"" for each muscle before and after the NMES. MEP amplitude increased significantly for TA (by 45 ± 6%) and for APB (56 ± 8%), but the amplitude of these increases was not different. In non-target muscles, MEPs increased significantly for muscles of the leg (42 ± 4%), but not the hand. Although NMES increased CS excitability for target muscles to the same extent in the leg and hand, the differences in the effect on non-target muscles suggest that NMES has a ""global"" effect on CS excitability for the leg and a ""focused"" effect for the hand. These differences may reflect differences in the specificity of afferent projections to the cortex. Global increases in CS excitability for the leg could be advantageous for rehabilitation as NMES applied to one muscle could strengthen CS pathways and enhance function for multiple muscles."
168,Anisotropy of transcallosal motor fibres indicates functional impairment in children with periventricular leukomalacia.,"Aim:In children with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy (CP), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is commonly identified on magnetic resonance imaging. We characterized this white matter condition by examining callosal microstructure, interhemispheric inhibitory competence (IIC), and mirror movements.Method:We examined seven children (age range 11y 9mo-17y 9mo, median age 15y 10mo, four females, three males) with bilateral spastic CP/PVL (Gross Motor Function Classification System level I or II, Manual Ability Classification System level I) and 12 age-matched controls (age range 11y 7mo-17y 1mo, median age 15y 6mo, seven females, five males). Fractional anisotropy of the transcallosal motor fibres (TCMF) and the corticospinal tract (CST) of both sides were calculated. The parameters of IIC (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and mirror movements were measured using a standardized clinical examination and a computer-based hand motor test.Results:Fractional anisotropy was lower in children with bilateral spastic CP/PVL regarding the TCMF, but not the left or right CST. Resting motor threshold was elevated in children with bilateral spastic CP/PVL whereas measures of IIC tended to be lower. Mirror movements were markedly elevated in bilateral spastic CP/PVL.Interpretation:This study provides new information on different aspects of motor function in children with bilateral spastic CP/PVL. Decreased fractional anisotropy of TCMF is consistent with impairment of hand motor function in children with bilateral spastic CP/PVL. The previously overlooked microstructure of the TCMF may serve as a potential indicator for hand motor function in patients with bilateral spastic CP/PVL."
169,[Slowly progressive dysarthria in primary lateral sclerosis].,"Slowly progressive dysarthria over many years may be the only sign of primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). Clinically it presents as pseudobulbar palsy which can be differentiated from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by the longer disease duration (> or =4 years), central pathological magnetic-evoked potentials to the tongue and lack of denervation in EMG. In contrast, hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is characterized by a primary spasticity of the lower limbs, mostly later onset, the fact that other family members are affected and in isolated cases by positive genetic testing for mutations."
170,Hand function in relation to brain lesions and corticomotor-projection pattern in children with unilateral cerebral palsy.,"Aim:To investigate relationships between hand function, brain lesions, and corticomotor projections in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP).Method:The study included 17 children (nine males, eight females; mean age 11.4 [SD 2.4] range 7-16 y), with unilateral CP at Gross Motor Function Classification System level I and Manual Ability Classification System level I or II. Hand function was assessed with the Box and Blocks test and Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA). Conventional structural magnetic resonance images were assessed visually for type, location, and extent of brain lesions. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provided information on organization of corticomotor projections.Results:The most favourable hand function was seen in children who had white-matter damage of immaturity with mild white-matter loss and contralateral motor projections. Children with ipsilateral projections had the most impaired function. Nevertheless, in this subgroup a range of ability was seen (AHA 29-59%). Motor-projection patterns appeared to be influenced by lesion extent and location, but not by lesion type.Interpretation:Combining information from structural magnetic resonance images and TMS can improve prediction of hand function. A wide variation in hand function was seen within all motor-projection patterns. Although the most impaired hand function was seen in the ipsilateral motor-projection group, some children in this group had fairly good ability. Such information is important for treatment planning."
171,"Experience, cortical remapping, and recovery in brain disease.","Recovery of motor function in brain and spinal cord disorders is an area of active research that seeks to maximize improvement after an episode of neuronal death or dysfunction. Recovery likely results from changes in structure and function of undamaged neurons, and this plasticity is a target for rehabilitative strategies. Sensory and motor function are mapped onto brain regions somatotopically, and these maps have been demonstrated to change in response to experience, particularly in development, but also in adults after injury. The map concept, while appealing, is limited, as the fine structure of the motor representation is not well-ordered somatotopically. But after stroke, the spared areas of the main cortical map for movement appear to participate in representing affected body parts, expanding representation in an experience-dependent manner. This occurs in both animal models and human clinical trials, although one must be cautious in comparing the results of invasive electrophysiological techniques with non-invasive ones such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. Developmental brain disorders, such as cerebral palsy, and embryonic abnormalities, such as dysmelia, demonstrate the potential of the human brain to remap the motor system. Future therapies may be able to use that potential to maximize recovery."
172,Brain connectivity: finding a cause.,A new study combining double-coil transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with TMS-induced 'virtual lesions' of the brain shows that the anterior intraparietal cortex causally influences interactions between ventral premotor and primary motor cortex during grasping.
173,INCITE: A randomised trial comparing constraint induced movement therapy and bimanual training in children with congenital hemiplegia.,"Background:Congenital hemiplegia is the most common form of cerebral palsy (CP) accounting for 1 in 1300 live births. These children have limitations in capacity to use the impaired upper limb and bimanual coordination deficits which impact on daily activities and participation in home, school and community life. There are currently two diverse intensive therapy approaches. Traditional therapy has adopted a bimanual approach (BIM training) and recently, constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) has emerged as a promising unimanual approach. Uncertainty remains about the efficacy of these interventions and characteristics of best responders. This study aims to compare the efficacy of CIMT to BIM training to improve outcomes across the ICF for school children with congenital hemiplegia.Methods/design:A matched pairs randomised comparison design will be used with children matched by age, gender, side of hemiplegia and level of upper limb function. Based on power calculations a sample size of 52 children (26 matched pairs) will be recruited. Children will be randomised within pairs to receive either CIMT or BIM training. Both interventions will use an intensive activity based day camp model, with groups receiving the same dosage of intervention delivered in the same environment (total 60 hours over 10 days). A novel circus theme will be used to enhance motivation. Groups will be compared at baseline, then at 3, 26 and 52 weeks following intervention. Severity of congenital hemiplegia will be classified according to brain structure (MRI and white matter fibre tracking), cortical excitability using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), functional use of the hand in everyday tasks (Manual Ability Classification System) and Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Outcomes will address neurovascular changes (functional MRI, functional connectivity), and brain (re)organisation (TMS), body structure and function (range of motion, spasticity, strength and sensation), activity limitations (upper limb unimanual capacity and bimanual motor coordination), participation restrictions (in home, school and recreation), environmental (barriers and facilitators to participation) and quality of life.Discussion:This paper outlines the theoretical basis, study hypotheses and outcome measures for a matched pairs randomised trial comparing CIMT and BIM training to improve outcomes across the ICF.Trial registration:ACTRN12609000912280."
174,Motor mapping in cerebral palsy.,"The measurement of motor deficits in individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) has been largely based on clinical criteria. Yet functional imaging and non-invasive stimulation methods provide a means to measure directly abnormalities of the motor system. The size and location of muscles and movement representations can be determined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetics resonance imaging. Thus the homunculus can be individually mapped in children with CP. Because size of representation within the homunculus relates to quality of motor control, measurement of the distance between body parts provides a metric that may be useful in classifying deficits. Bilateral motor control in one hemisphere, while normal in neonates, persists variably in CP, providing another physiological metric. In this study, we used TMS to measure hand and ankle representations in a convenience sample of children with spastic CP. Overlapping thumb and ankle maps were found in children with both hemiplegia and diplegia, and these maps may be from either side of the body. While more participants are required to make conclusions about disability and compression/bilaterality of the homunculus, it appears as if TMS-derived metrics relate to motor abnormalities. These abnormal motor maps also are a therapeutic target, as stimulation methods are being developed as adjuncts to physical means of rehabilitation."
175,Unaffected motor cortex remodeling after hemispherectomy in an epileptic cerebral palsy patient. A TMS and fMRI study.,"Purpose:Here we describe pre- and post-operative neurophysiological and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings in a young epileptic girl with right hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and fMRI for predicting a post-surgical outcome and for evaluating functional cortical reorganization.Methods:We used TMS and fMRI to evaluate the excitability of the human motor cortex and cortical map representation before and after functional hemispherectomy. TMS was performed using single- and paired-pulse stimulation protocol. Cortical silent periods (CSPs), short interval intra-cortical inhibition (SICI), volume, area and center of gravity (CoG) of cortical map representation were studied before and after surgery. fMRI was done using the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) technique with block-designed protocols.Results:After surgery the patient showed an improvement of her clinical status and TMS and fMRI demonstrated a reshaping of cortical representation of motor cortex and a significant reduction of cortical silent periods.Discussion:Before surgery, the combination of a clinical, neurophysiological and neuro-radiological approach may be predictable of the neurological outcome in epileptic patients. Moreover, the patient we describe provides new pieces of information in the mechanisms of plasticity underlying motor recovery after epilepsy surgery."
176,Brain function decline in healthy retired athletes who sustained their last sports concussion in early adulthood.,"Recent studies have shown that the detrimental effects of sports concussions on cognitive and motor function may persist up to a few years post-injury. The present study sought to investigate the effects of having sustained a sports concussion more than 30 years prior to testing on cognitive and motor functions. Nineteen healthy former athletes, in late adulthood (mean age = 60.79; SD = 5.16), who sustained their last sport-related concussion in early adulthood (mean age = 26.05; SD = 9.21) were compared with 21 healthy former athletes with no history of concussion (mean age = 58.89; SD = 9.07). Neuropsychological tests sensitive to age-related changes in cognition were administered. An auditory oddball paradigm was used to evoke P3a and P3b brain responses. Four TMS paradigms were employed to assess motor cortex excitability: (i) resting motor threshold; (ii) paired-pulse intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation; (iii) input/output curve and (iv) cortical silent period (CSP). A rapid alternating movement task was also used to characterize motor system dysfunctions. Relative to controls, former athletes with a history of concussion had: (i) lower performance on neuropsychological tests of episodic memory and response inhibition; (ii) significantly delayed and attenuated P3a/P3b components; (iii) significantly prolonged CSP and (iv) significantly reduced movement velocity (bradykinesia). The finding that the P3, the CSP as well as neuropsychological and motor indices were altered more than three decades post-concussion provides evidence for the chronicity of cognitive and motor system changes consecutive to sports concussion."
177,Antidepressant-like effects of nicotine and transcranial magnetic stimulation in the olfactory bulbectomy rat model of depression.,"In this study, we compared the depression-like symptoms induced by olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) in the two inbred Wistar and Long Evans rat strains. We also analyzed the self-regulated oral intake of nicotine in these strains and the effect of nicotine on the depression-like symptoms of olfactory bulbectomy. Furthermore, we compared the antidepressant-like effects of nicotine on Wistar rats to those of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which has emerged as a therapeutic alternative for depression management. Our results show that Wistar rats develop depression-like symptoms, demonstrated by the forced swim test (FST), 4 weeks after OBX. However, in bulbectomized Long Evans rats these symptoms cannot be assessed due to a higher degree of variability of the swimming behavior of this strain. These results suggest that there are some innate differences in susceptibility to stress between these two rat strains. In Wistar rats, voluntary oral nicotine intake (1.2 mg/(kg day) for 14 days) as well as nicotine administered as a single daily i.p. injection (1.5 mg/(kg day) for 14 days) decrease the depression-like symptoms of OBX. Daily transcranial magnetic stimulation (60 Hz and 0.7 mT for 2h/day for 14 days) also decreases depression-like symptoms but is less effective than nicotine. In conclusion, our results support the idea that there are possible innate differences for depression susceptibility and that nicotine and TMS may be useful in the treatment of this syndrome."
178,Functional topography of early periventricular brain lesions in relation to cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps.,"Early periventricular brain lesions can not only cause cerebral palsy, but can also induce a reorganization of language. Here, we asked whether these different functional consequences can be attributed to topographically distinct portions of the periventricular white matter damage. Eight patients with pre- and perinatally acquired left-sided periventricular brain lesions underwent focal transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess the integrity of cortico-spinal hand motor projections, and functional MRI to determine the hemispheric organization of language production. MRI lesion-symptom mapping revealed that two distinct portions of the periventricular lesions were critically involved in the disruption of cortico-spinal hand motor projections on the one hand and in the induction of language reorganization into the contra-lesional right hemisphere on the other hand. Both regions are located in a position compatible with the course of cortico-spinal/cortico-nuclear projections of the primary motor cortex in the periventricular white matter, as determined by the stereotaxic probabilistic cytoarchitectonic atlas developed by the Jülich group."
179,Upper limb corticomotor projections and physiological changes that occur with botulinum toxin-A therapy in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy.,"Aim:To investigate the corticomotor projection to the upper limb in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP) and the changes that occur with botulinum toxin (BTX)-A.Methods:The study design is a pilot prospective randomized trial. Twenty-two children with hemiplegic CP aged 7 years to 13 years 11 months were recruited. Treatment group (12) received one series of BTX-A injections into the upper limb. Control group (10) did not receive upper limb BTX-A. All participants except one treatment group participant also received lower limb BTX-A. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was performed at baseline, and 1, 3 and 6 months post-injection. Outcome measures were: change in position of affected and unaffected side first dorsal interosseous optimal site of stimulation (OPTx).Results:A shift in affected and unaffected side OPTx was observed for both treatment and control groups, and there was no statistically significant difference between groups at 1, 3 or 6 months. Poor tolerance of TMS cortical stimuli >80% was observed.Conclusion:Corticomotor projections associated with the upper limb in children with hemiplegic CP show significant variability over a 6-month period. This variability may reflect central motor reorganization because of systemic BTX-A effect or developmental changes. Upper limb BTX-A therapy is associated with reorganization of both affected and unaffected projections. Poor tolerance of the TMS procedure, in conjunction with higher cortical thresholds, may limit the usefulness of TMS as an investigatory tool in young children with movement disorders."
180,Transcranial magnetic stimulation in children.,"Developmental disabilities (e.g. attention deficit disorder; cerebral palsy) are frequently associated with deviations of the typical pattern of motor skill maturation. Neurophysiologic tools, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which probe motor cortex function, can potentially provide insights into both typical neuromotor maturation and the mechanisms underlying the motor skill deficits in children with developmental disabilities. These insights may set the stage for finding effective interventions for these disorders. We review the literature pertaining to the use of TMS in pediatrics. Most TMS-evoked parameters show age-related changes in typically developing children and some of these are abnormal in a number of childhood-onset neurological disorders. Although no TMS-evoked parameters are diagnostic for any disorder, changes in certain parameters appear to reflect disease burden or may provide a measure of treatment-related improvement. Furthermore, TMS may be especially useful when combined with other neurophysiologic modalities (e.g. fMRI). However, much work remains to be done to determine if TMS-evoked parameters can be used as valid and reliable biomarkers for disease burden, the natural history of neurological injury and repair, and the efficacy of pharmacological and rehabilitation interventions."
181,Altered cortical inhibitory function in children with spastic diplegia: a TMS study.,"Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is the most frequent cause of spastic diplegia. The movement disorder is attributed to damage to the corticospinal tract, but there is increasing evidence of additional cortical dysfunction associated with PVL. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the integrity of the corticospinal tract and cortical inhibitory function using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Fifteen children with bilateral PVL and spastic diplegia and twenty-two healthy children underwent single-pulse stimulations to the right tibial anterior muscle. We compared central motor conduction time and amplitudes of motor evoked potentials as markers for corticospinal integrity and the postexcitatory silent period (SP), representing cortical inhibitory interneurons. The patients' parameters of corticospinal tract function did not differ significantly from those in the control children. In contrast, the SP was significantly shortened in children with PVL (mean 25.6 +/- 6.9 ms; controls: mean 47.6 +/- 23.2 ms, P = 0.018). This suggests cortical involvement with reduced cortical inhibitory function in PVL. This could be due to impaired functioning of the cortical interneurons themselves, or to decreased input from activating fibres, e.g. thalamocortical or cortico-cortical connections."
182,Persistent mirror movements for over sixty years: the underlying mechanisms in a cerebral palsy patient.,"Objective:To determine the mechanisms underlying the mirroring of distal movements in both upper and lower limbs present in one individual from birth.Methods:Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), voluntary and reflexly evoked electromyograms (EMG) and force measurements were used to obtain information about the motor pathways responsible for the mirror movements.Results:MRI showed a significant loss of brain tissue from one hemisphere and fMRI indicated a significant functional reorganization had taken place. An obligatory mirroring of voluntary movement on the sound side occurs on the affected side, but some independent movement can be produced on the affected side, if enabled by weak contractions on the sound side. TMS mapping revealed bilateral projections from one hemisphere and virtually absent projections from the primary motor cortex of the other hemisphere. Spinal reflexes were restricted to the stimulated side. Transcortical reflexes were evoked bilaterally from the sound side, but not from the affected side.Conclusions:The physiological and imaging data are consistent with a mirroring from the intact motor cortex via the supplementary motor area.Significance:Mirror movements in this individual represent a major cortical reorganization and a partial solution to the neonatal loss of substantial amounts of brain tissue."
183,The effect of a series of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulations of the motor cortex on central pain after spinal cord injury.,"Objective:To study the analgesic effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the motor cortex on central pain in patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI).Design:Double-blind randomized controlled trial. Mean follow-up period was 4.5 weeks.Setting:General hospital.Participants:Twelve paraplegic patients due to thoracic SCI suffering chronic central pain (11 completed the study) who were randomly selected from a list of eligible patients.Intervention:Real or sham 10 daily motor rTMS treatments (500 trains at 5 Hz for 10 s; total of 500 pulses at intensity of 115% of motor threshold) using figure-of-8 coil over the vertex.Main outcome measures:Chronic pain intensity (visual analog scale [VAS], McGill Pain Questionnaire [MPQ]), pain threshold, and level of depression (Beck Depression Inventory).Results:Both real and sham TMS induced a similar, significant reduction in VAS scores (P<.001) immediately after each of the 10 treatment sessions and in VAS and MPQ scores after the end of the treatment series. However, only real rTMS conferred a significant increase in heat-pain threshold (4 degrees C, P<.05) by the end of the series. Most important, the reduction in MPQ scores in the real rTMS group continued during the follow-up period. Depression scores were equally reduced in both groups but similar to pain relief, depression continued to improve at follow-up in the real rTMS group.Conclusions:Whereas the pain alleviation induced by a single rTMS treatment is probably due to placebo, patients with SCI may benefit from a series of rTMS treatments."
184,Is hemiplegic cerebral palsy equivalent to amblyopia of the corticospinal system?,"Objective:Subjects with severe hemiplegic cerebral palsy have increased ipsilateral corticospinal projections from their noninfarcted cortex. We investigated whether their severe impairment might, in part, be caused by activity-dependent, competitive displacement of surviving contralateral corticospinal projections from the affected cortex by more active ipsilateral corticospinal projections from the nonaffected cortex, thereby compounding the impairment.Methods:Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) characterized corticospinal tract development from each hemisphere over the first 2 years in 32 healthy children, 14 children with unilateral stroke, and 25 with bilateral lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging and anatomic studies compared corticospinal tract growth in 13 patients with perinatal stroke with 46 healthy subjects.Results:Infants with unilateral lesions initially had responses after TMS of the affected cortex, which became progressively more abnormal, and seven were eventually lost. There was associated hypertrophy of the ipsilateral corticospinal axons projecting from the noninfarcted cortex. Magnetic resonance imaging and anatomic studies demonstrated hypertrophy of the corticospinal tract from the noninfarcted hemisphere. TMS findings soon after the stroke did not predict impairment; subsequent loss of responses and hypertrophy of ipsilateral corticospinal axons from the noninfarcted cortex predicted severe impairment at 2 years. Infants with bilateral lesions maintained responses to TMS from both hemispheres with a normal pattern of development.Interpretation:Rather than representing ""reparative plasticity,"" increased ipsilateral projections from the noninfarcted cortex compound disability by competitively displacing surviving contralateral corticospinal projections from the infarcted cortex. This may provide a pathophysiological explanation for why signs of hemiplegic cerebral palsy appear late and progress over the first 2 years of life."
185,Low and high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of spasticity.,"The development of non-invasive techniques of cortical stimulation, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), has opened new potential avenues for the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases. We hypothesized that an increase in the activity in the motor cortex by cortical stimulation would increase its inhibitory influence on spinal excitability through the corticospinal tract and, thus, reduce the hyperactivity of the gamma and alpha neurons, improving spasticity. Seventeen participants (eight males, nine females; mean age 9y 1mo [SD 3y 2mo]) with cerebral palsy and spastic quadriplegia were randomized to receive sham, active 1Hz, or active 5Hz repetitive TMS of the primary motor cortex. Stimulation was applied for 5 consecutive days (90% of motor threshold). The results showed that there was a significant reduction of spasticity after 5Hz, but not sham or 1Hz, stimulation as indexed by the degree of passive movement; however this was not evident when using the Ashworth scale, although a trend for improvement was seen for elbow movement. The safety evaluation showed that stimulation with either 1Hz or 5Hz did not result in any adverse events as compared with sham stimulation. Results of this trial provide initial evidence to support further trials exploring the use of cortical stimulation in the treatment of spasticity."
186,Corticospinal tract development and its plasticity after perinatal injury.,"The final pattern of the origin and termination of the corticospinal tract is shaped during development by the balance between projection and withdrawal of axons. In animals, unilateral inhibition of the sensorimotor cortex during development results in a sparse contralateral projection from this cortex and retention of a greater number of ipsilateral projections from the more active cortex. Similarly in subjects with hemiplegic cerebral palsy if transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the damaged motor cortex fails to evoke responses in the paretic upper limb, TMS of the undamaged ipsilateral motor cortex evokes abnormally large and short-onset responses. Rather than representing a ""reparative plasticity in response to injury"", this review presents evidence that increased ipsilateral projections from the non-infarcted motor cortex arise from perturbation of ongoing developmental processes, whereby reduced activity in the damaged hemisphere, leads to increased withdrawal of its surviving contralateral corticospinal projections because their terminals have been displaced by the more active ipsilateral projections of the undamaged hemisphere and thereby adding to the degree of long-term motor impairment."
187,Activity- and use-dependent plasticity of the developing corticospinal system.,"The corticospinal (CS) system, critical for controlling skilled movements, develops during the late prenatal and early postnatal periods in all species examined. In the cat, there is a sequence of development of the mature pattern of terminations of CS tract axons in the spinal gray matter, followed by motor map development of the primary motor cortex. Skilled limb movements begin to be expressed as the map develops. Development of the proper connections between CS axons and spinal neurons in cats depends on CS neural activity and motor behavioral experience during a critical postnatal period. Reversible CS inactivation or preventing limb use produces an aberrant distribution of CS axon terminations and impairs visually guided movements. This altered pattern of CS connections after inactivation in cats resembles the aberrant pattern of motor responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation in hemiplegic cerebral palsy patients. Left untreated in the cat, these impairments do not resolve. We have found that activity-dependent processes can be harnessed in cats to reestablish normal CS connections and function. This finding suggests that aspects of normal CS connectivity and function might some day be restored in hemiplegic cerebral palsy."
188,Motor evoked potentials: prognostic value in motor recovery after stroke.,"Accurate motor and functional prognosis after stroke is important for the optimal planning of a personalised rehabilitation programme, and clinical, demographic and radiological data are commonly employed for this purpose. It is becoming increasingly apparent that motor evoked potentials (MEPs), obtained through transcranial magnetic stimulation, can furnish complementary prognostic information on motor outcome after stroke, particularly when initial hand palsy is present. To evaluate the prognostic value of early MEPs together with other clinical variables, 19 subjects with first- ever stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory and hand palsy at onset, were evaluated in the acute phase. These cases were retrospectively selected out of a sample of 33 subjects. Multivariate analysis was carried out using amplitude of MEPs, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (NIH) and Motricity Index as independent variables, and Medical Research Council scale score (MRC) as the dependent outcome variable at 4 months after stroke. The best model, which combined NIH and MEP data, accounted for 75.44% of the variability of the MRC. Our results suggest that the NIH and MEPs may yield information useful for predicting hand motor outcome after stroke in the presence of initial hand palsy, a condition in which a prognosis made on the basis solely of clinical data is deemed more difficult."
189,Magnetic stimulation of human premotor or motor cortex produces interhemispheric facilitation through distinct pathways.,"We explored interhemispheric facilitation (IHF) between (a) left and right primary motor cortex (M1) and (b) left dorsal premotor (dPM) and right M1 in 20 right-handed healthy human subjects using a paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol. A conditioning TMS pulse (CP) applied to left M1 or dPM with an intensity of 80% and 60% active motor threshold (CP(80%AMT) and CP(60%AMT), respectively) was followed by a test pulse (TP) over right M1 induced by anterior-posterior- or posterior-anterior- (TP(AP), TP(PA)) directed currents in the brain at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 3-8 and 10 ms. EMG was recorded from left first dorsal interosseous muscle. In the main experimental condition IHF was evoked by CP(80%AMT) over left M1 and TPAP at ISIs of 6 and 8 ms. The same CP(80%AMT) produced IHF at an ISI of 8 ms when applied over left dPM but only with TP(PA). In addition, when CP(60%AMT) was given to M1, IHF was present at an ISI of 6 ms (but not 8 ms) when followed by TP(PA), indicating that IHF elicited over dPM was not caused by current spread of the conditioning pulse to M1. We conclude that IHF can be induced differentially by conditioning M1 and dPM using subthreshold CP. These facilitatory interactions depended on the intensity and ISI of the CP as well as the current flow direction of the TP. We suggest that not only do the CPs activate separate anatomical pathways but also that these pathways project to different populations ofinterneurons in the receiving M1. These may correspond to elements involved in the generation of I3 and I1 waves, respectively."
190,Neurophysiologic and neuroimaging studies of brain plasticity in children with spastic cerebral palsy.,"Patients with cerebral palsy (CP) may have some problems other than this motor impairment: mental retardation, epilepsy and sensory disturbance. Healthy children and children with CP have an enhanced capacity for learning and memory compared to adults. There are few tools for brain plasticity investigations. The utility of the neurophysiologic and MRI techniques in the determination of brain reorganization and repair in patients with cerebral palsy is described. The authors discuss their results of quantitative EEG and spectroscopy MRI studies in children with CP. Quantitative EEG and spectroscopy MRI can be useful tools in the determination of these processes in children with CP."
191,Clinical correlation between motor evoked potentials and gait recovery in poststroke patients.,"Objective:To evaluate, in patients with a stroke in the area of the middle cerebral artery, whether transcranial magnetic stimulation values from the affected lower limb correlated with the degree of gait recovery.Design:The prognostic evaluation in subjects with complete lower-limb palsy, inability to walk, and dependence in the activities of daily living, 1 month after vascular injury.Setting:University-affiliated rehabilitation hospital.Participants:Twenty consecutive patients (12 women, 8 men) were enrolled 1 month poststroke (30+/-5 d); all patients concluded the rehabilitation program, which lasted 6 months.Intervention:Barthel Index score, Hemiplegic Stroke Scale (HSS) score, and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the tibialis anterior muscle were performed 1, 4, and 7 months poststroke. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient were employed.Main outcome measures:The independence of gait defined as an HSS gait score of 3 or less (ability to walk without assistance apart from a stick or cane).Results:Patients with no recordable MEPs 1 month poststroke never regained walking ability; patients with MEPs of 8% or more (13.11+/-5.95) regained independent gait at discharge. It was not possible to predict walking capacity in patients with MEPs less than 8% (4.0+/-1.41). Four months postinjury, walking capacity was achieved only by the patients with MEPs of 18% or more (23.1+/-6.2).Conclusions:In the postacute phase of stroke, the lower-limb MEP amplitudes could be a supportive tool for prognosis of lower-limb motor outcome."
192,The role of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in ocular motor behavior.,"The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is involved in the preparation of saccadic eye movements. Lesion studies and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest that the human DLPFC is located in area 46 of Brodmann. The DLPFC has direct connections with the main cortical ocular motor areas, that is with the frontal eye field (FEF) and the supplementary eye field (SEF) in the frontal lobe; with several (associative, attentional, and motor) areas in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), including the parietal eye field (PEF); with the cingulate eye field in the anterior cingulate cortex; and directly downstream with the superior colliculus in the brainstem. Lesion and fMRI studies using the antisaccade paradigm have shown that the DLPFC is involved in the inhibition of unwanted reflexive saccades (triggered toward the target by the PEF), whereas the triggering of correct intentional antisaccades (made in the direction opposite to the target) may depend mainly upon the FEF. The DLPFC also controls short-term spatial working memory involved in memory-guided saccades, as shown by lesion and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies. By contrast, medium-term spatial memory (after 25 s) may be controlled by the medial temporal cortex (MTC). Recently, TMS studies have suggested that the transmission of memorized information from the integrative parietal areas (PPC) to the MTC is performed via both an indirect pathway comprising the DLPFC (i.e., transmission in series) and a direct pathway bypassing the DLPFC (i.e., transmission in parallel). Furthermore, the DLPFC is involved in the preparation of predictive saccades (i.e., saccades made before the appearance of an expected target) and saccade sequences, and, therefore, also controls some aspects of temporal working memory. Lastly, the involvement of the DLPFC has recently been reported in tasks comprising a target selection or a directional decision to make for the forthcoming saccade. These different functions suggest that the DLPFC plays a major role in the decisional processes governing ocular motor behavior."
193,Intraoperative motor mapping of the cerebral peduncle during resection of a midbrain cavernous malformation: technical case report.,"Objective and importance:Brainstem cavernous malformations that seem to come to a pial or ependymal surface on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging studies may, in fact, be covered by an intact layer of neural tissue. For cavernous malformations in the cerebral peduncle, intraoperative stimulation mapping with a miniaturized probe can determine whether this overlying tissue harbors fibers in the corticospinal tract. In addition, intermittent monitoring with transcranial motor evoked potentials (TcMEPs) helps to protect this vital pathway during resection of the lesion.Clinical presentation:A 20-year-old woman collapsed after a cavernous malformation in the left cerebral peduncle hemorrhaged into the pons, midbrain, and thalamus. She presented with right hemiparesis and left oculomotor palsy.Intervention:The cavernous malformation was completely resected through a left orbitozygomatic craniotomy and transsylvian approach. Stimulation mapping of the cerebral peduncle with a Kartush probe (Medtronic Xomed, Inc., Jacksonville, FL) identified the corticospinal tract lateral to the lesion, and a layer of tissue over the lesion harbored no motor fibers. TcMEP monitoring helped to guide the resection, with increased voltage thresholds and altered waveform morphologies indicating transient impaired motor conduction. All TcMEP changes returned to baseline by the end of the procedure, and the patient's hemiparesis improved after surgery.Conclusion:Stimulation mapping of the corticospinal tract and intermittent TcMEPs is a safe and simple surgical adjunct. Expanded monitoring of the motor pathway during the resection of cerebral peduncle cavernous malformations may improve the safety of these operations."
194,Corticospinal disinhibition during dual action.,"When attempting to perform two tasks simultaneously, the human motor as well as the cognitive system shows interference. Such interference often causes altered activation of the cortical area representing each task compared to the single task condition. We investigated changes in corticospinal inhibition during dual action by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Single-pulse TMS was applied to the left motor cortex, triggered by right leg movement (tibialis anterior muscle) while the right abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle was moderately activated (10-20% of the maximal voluntary contraction). The background electromyography (EMG) activity of ADM was measured before and during the leg movement. The silent period (SP) and amplitude of motor evoked potential (MEP) following magnetic stimulation in active ADM were compared for the conditions with and without leg movement. The mean area of the rectified EMG activity of ADM did not alter, while the SP was significantly shortened during leg movement compared to that without leg movement. MEP amplitude was comparable between the two conditions. These results suggest that corticospinal inhibition tested by the SP duration is reduced during the movement of another body part, presumably in order to help maintain muscle force by compensating interference-related alteration in motor cortical activation."
195,Short-term effects of functional electrical stimulation on motor-evoked potentials in ankle flexor and extensor muscles.,"Stimulating sensory afferents can increase corticospinal excitability. Intensive use of a particular part of the body can also induce reorganization of neural circuits (use-dependent plasticity) in the central nervous system (CNS). What happens in the CNS when the nerve stimulation is applied in concert with the use of particular muscle groups? The purpose of this study was to investigate short-term effects of electrical stimulation of the common peroneal (CP) nerve during walking on motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the ankle flexors and extensors in healthy subjects. Since the stimulation was applied during the swing phase of the step cycle when the ankle flexors are active, this is referred to as functional electrical stimulation (FES). The following questions were addressed: (1) can FES during walking increase corticospinal excitability more effectively than passively received repetitive nerve stimulation and (2) does walking itself improve the descending connection. FES was delivered using a foot drop stimulator that activates ankle dorsiflexors during the swing phase of the step cycle. MEPs in the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus muscles were measured before, between, and after periods of walking with or without FES, using transcranial magnetic stimulation. After 30 min of walking with FES, the half-maximum peak-to-peak MEP (MEP(h)) in the TA increased in amplitude and this facilitatory effect lasted for at least 30 min. In contrast, walking had no effects on the TA MEP(h) without FES. The increase in the TA MEP(h) with FES (approximately 40%) was similar to that with repetitive CP nerve stimulation at rest. The soleus MEP(h) was also increased after walking with FES, but not without FES, which differs from the previous observation with CP nerve stimulation at rest. With FES, the TA silent period at MEP(h) was unchanged or slightly decreased, while it increased after walking without FES. Increased cortical excitability accompanied by unchanged cortical inhibition (no changes in the silent period with FES) suggests that FES did not simply increase general excitability of the cortex, but had specific effects on particular cortical neurons."
196,Electrophysiological assessment of the effect of intrathecal baclofen in dystonic children.,"Objective:To evaluate the effect of intrathecal baclofen in a group of dystonic children using electrophysiological procedures previously validated in spastic children.Methods:Seven children (aged 2-16 years) with dystonia of various aetiologies (dyskinetic cerebral palsy, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome) underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation, H-reflex and flexor reflex studies before and after intrathecal injection of baclofen. The Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale (BADS) was used for clinical evaluation of dystonia.Results:Motor-evoked potentials, present in 2 of 5 patients before baclofen, were preserved after injection. Before baclofen, H reflex was present in 6 of 7 patients (mean H(max)/M(max:) 0.45+/-0.21). It was markedly reduced after the injection (mean H(max)/M(max:) 0.09+/-0.11) (P<0.001). Area of flexor reflex significantly decreased after baclofen (P=0.047), while threshold significantly increased (P=0.01). No significant clinical improvement of the BADS scores was observed (P=0.058).Conclusions:These electrophysiological procedures, previously demonstrated to quantify the action of intrathecal baclofen in spastic adults and children, also appear sensitive in dystonic children. The electrophysiological changes are consistent with primarily spinal sites of action of baclofen. They appear more sensitive than clinical evaluation."
197,Eye movement control by the cerebral cortex.,"Purpose of review:This review focuses on eye movement control by the cerebral cortex, mainly in humans. Data have emerged based on the important contribution of recent techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging, which provide complementary results to those of the classical lesion and electrical stimulation studies.Recent findings:The location of the human frontal eye field and its role in pursuit eye movement control were recently detailed. Cumulative evidence for the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in unwanted reflexive saccade inhibition, short-term spatial memory and prediction suggests that this area controls decisional processes governing ocular motor behaviour. The organization of spatial memory in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (short-term), the parahippocampal cortex (medium-term) and the hippocampal formation (long-term) is also reviewed with the results of recent transcranial magnetic stimulation studies. The relatively complicated anatomy of the posterior parietal cortex in humans is briefly described followed by some additional results concerning the location of the parietal eye field - within the posterior half of the intraparietal sulcus - and its role in visuo-spatial integration and attention. The other areas involved in spatial attention are also examined in the light of several recent contributing reports. Lastly, there are also new functional magnetic resonance imaging findings concerning the posterior cingulate cortex, which appears to be mainly involved in the control of externally guided eye movements and attentional mechanisms.Summary:Many new findings on the organization of saccades and pursuit eye movements at the cortical level have recently been reported. Furthermore, eye movements are increasingly used as a tool to elucidate relatively complex neuropsychological processes such as attention, spatial memory, motivation and decisional processes, and a considerable number of reports dealing with these questions have been observed."
198,Electrical stimulation of the human common peroneal nerve elicits lasting facilitation of cortical motor-evoked potentials.,"Motor-evoked potentials (MEP) in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle were shown to be facilitated by repetitive electrical stimulation of the common peroneal (CP) nerve at intensities above motor threshold. The TA electromyogram (EMG) and ankle flexion force were recorded in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the leg area of the motor cortex to evaluate the excitability of cortico-spinal-muscular pathways. Repetitive stimulation of the CP nerve at 25 Hz for 30 min increased the MEP by 50.3 +/- 13.6% (mean +/- S.E.) at a TMS intensity that initially gave a half-maximum MEP (MEPh). In contrast the maximum MEP (MEPmax) did not change. Ankle flexion force (103 +/- 21.9%) and silent period duration (75.3 +/- 12.9%) also increased. These results suggest an increase in corticospinal excitability, rather than total connectivity due to repetitive CP stimulation. Facilitation was evident after as little as 10 min of stimulation and persisted without significant decrement for at least 30 min after stimulation. The long duration of silent period following CP stimulation (99.2 +/- 14.8 ms) suggests that this form of stimulation may have effects on the motor cortex. To exclude the possibility that MEPh facilitation was primarily due to sensory fibre activation, we performed several control experiments. Preferentially activating Ia muscle afferents by vibration in the absence of motor activity had no significant effect. Cutaneous afferent activation via stimulation of the superficial peroneal nerve increased the amplitude of responses at MEPmax rather than MEPh. Concurrent tendon vibration and superficial peroneal nerve stimulation failed to facilitate TA MEP responses. In summary, repetitive electrical stimulation of the CP nerve elicits lasting changes in corticospinal excitability, possibly as a result of co-activating motor and sensory fibres."
199,Post-stroke reorganization of hand motor area: a 1-year prospective follow-up with focal transcranial magnetic stimulation.,"Objective:Focal transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to test prospectively corticospinal excitability changes and reorganization of first dorsal interosseous (FDI) motor cortical representation in 31 patients who experienced a first ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory. All had severe hand palsy at onset.Methods:Patients were assessed clinically with the Medical Research Council, Rankin, the National Institutes of Health stroke scales and Barthel Index at days 1, 8, 30, 90, 180 and 360 after stroke. The following parameters of FDI motor evoked potential (MEPS) to focal transcranial magnetic stimulation were measured at the same delays: motor threshold, MEP amplitude, excitable cortical area, hot spot and center of gravity of FDI motor maps on affected and unaffected hemispheres. Correlations were sought between clinical and electrophysiological parameters.Results:In patients whose affected motor cortex remained excitable at day 1, motor thresholds were not significantly different between sides and were similar to those of controls. Persistence of MEP on the affected side at day 1 was a strong predictor of good recovery. If present at day 1, MEPs recorded in affected FDI were significantly smaller than of the opposite side or in normals and progressively recovered up to day 360. In these patients, area of excitable cortex remained stable throughout the entire study. At day 1, amplitudes of MEPs obtained in unaffected FDI were significantly larger than later. Between days 1 and 360, we observed a significant displacement of center of gravity of motor maps towards more frontal regions on the affected side while no change was noted on the unaffected side.Conclusions:Our data confirm the early prognosis value of transcranial magnetic stimulation in stroke. They indicate that the brain insult induces a transient hyperexcitability of the unaffected motor cortex. The evolution of FDI motor maps along the course of recovery mostly reflect corticospinal excitability changes but might also reveal some degree of brain plasticity. Most modifications observed occurred within 3 months of stroke onset."
