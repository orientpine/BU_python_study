0,Cortical control of ocular saccades in humans: a model for motricity.,"Our knowledge of the cortical control of saccadic eye movements (saccades) in humans has recently progressed mainly thanks to lesion and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies, but also to functional imaging. It is now well-known that the frontal eye field is involved in the triggering of intentional saccades, the parietal eye field in that of reflexive saccades, the supplementary eye field (SEF) in the initiation of motor programs comprising saccades, the pre-SEF in learning of these programs, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in saccade inhibition, prediction and spatial working memory. Saccades may also be used as a convenient model of motricity to study general cognitive processes preparing movements, such as attention, spatial memory and motivation. Visuo-spatial attention appears to be controlled by a bilateral parieto-frontal network comprising different parts of the posterior parietal cortex and the frontal areas involved in saccade control, suggesting that visual attentional shifts and saccades are closely linked. Recently, our understanding of the cortical control of spatial memory has noticeably progressed by using the simple visuo-oculomotor model represented by the memory-guided saccade paradigm, in which a single saccade is made to the remembered position of a unique visual item presented a while before. TMS studies have determined that, after a brief stage of spatial integration in the posterior parietal cortex (inferior to 300 ms), short-term spatial memory (i.e. up to 15-20 s) is controlled by the DLPFC. Behavioral and lesion studies have shown that medium-term spatial memory (between 15-20 s and a few minutes) is specifically controlled by the parahippocampal cortex, before long-term memorization (i.e. after a few minutes) in the hippocampal formation. Lastly, it has been shown that the posterior part of the anterior cingulate cortex, called the cingulate eye field, is involved in motivation and the preparation of all intentional saccades, but not in reflexive saccades. These different but complementary study methods used in humans have thus contributed to a better understanding of both eye movement physiology and general cognitive processes preparing motricity as whole."
1,Motor cortical disinhibition in the unaffected hemisphere after unilateral cortical stroke.,"Following a hemispheric stroke, various degrees of neuronal reorganization around the lesion occur immediately after disease onset and thereafter up to several months. These include transcallosal excitability, changes of the intact motor cortex and ipsilateral motor responses after transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the intact hemisphere. To elucidate the relationship between lesion localization and motor cortex excitability (intracortical inhibition; ICI) in the intact hemisphere, we applied a paired conditioning-test TMS paradigm in 12 patients with unilateral cortical stroke (cortical group) and nine patients with subcortical stroke caudal to the corpus callosum (subcortical group), with interstimulus intervals varying from 1 to 10 ms. All patients exhibited unilateral complete hand palsy. ICI was significantly less in the cortical group than in age-matched healthy control subjects. It was especially more marked in the cortical group patients with a disease duration of less than 4 months after onset. Patients in the cortical group with a duration longer than 4 months showed a tendency for ICI to be normalized, and there was a significant correlation between ICI and disease duration. Patients in the subcortical group showed normal excitability curves. All patients in the cortical group showed no transcallosal inhibition (TCI) in the active unaffected hand muscle after TMS of the affected motor cortex, whereas all the subcortical patients showed some TCI. No ipsilateral motor responses were elicited in the paretic hand in any of the patients. The reduced ICI in the cortical group might have been a result of disruption of TCI. The normalization of ICI in the patients with longer disease duration and the normal ICI in the subcortical group patients do not support the functional significance of motor cortex hyperexcitability in the unaffected hemisphere, at least in a patient population with poor motor recovery."
2,Cortical control of spatial memory in humans: the visuooculomotor model.,"We review current knowledge of the cortical control of spatial memory, studied using visuooculomotor paradigms. Spatial memory is an essential cognitive process that can be involved in preparing motor responses. Our knowledge of spatial memory in humans recently has progressed thanks to the use of ocular saccades as a convenient model of motor behavior. Accuracy of memory-guided saccades, made to the remembered locations of visual targets, is a reflection of spatial memory. For the performance of memory-guided saccades with brief delays (up to 15-20 seconds), that is, involving short-term spatial memory, lesion studies have shown that the posterior parietal cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the frontal eye field play significant roles. Studies of memory-guided saccades using transcranial magnetic stimulation have suggested that the right posterior parietal cortex is involved at the initial stage (<300 milliseconds) of visuospatial integration, whereas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in both hemispheres controls the following phase of short-term memorization, the frontal eye field mainly serving to trigger saccades. The new concept of a medium-term spatial memory has emerged from a behavioral study of memory-guided saccades in normal subjects, showing a paradoxical spontaneous improvement of spatial memory after delays of approximately 20 seconds. Lesion studies have shown that the parahippocampal cortex could specifically control this medium-term spatial memory. Last, different experimental and clinical arguments suggest that, after a few minutes, the hippocampal formation finally takes over the control of spatial memory for long-term spatial memorization. Therefore, spatial memory involved in the memorization of visual items could be successively controlled by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (short-term spatial memory), the parahippocampal cortex (medium-term spatial memory), and the hippocampal formation (long-term spatial memory), depending on specific periods of times. The applicability of this simple visuooculomotor model of spatial memory to other types of stimuli and general motoricity has yet to be confirmed."
3,Effects of cortical lesions on saccadic: eye movements in humans.,"Our knowledge of the cortical control of saccadic eye movements (saccades) in humans has recently progressed mainly because of lesion and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies, but also because of functional imaging. It is now well known that the frontal eye field is involved in the control of intentional saccades, the parietal eye field in that of reflexive saccades, the supplementary eye field (SEF) in the initiation of motor programs comprising saccades, the pre-SEF in the learning of these programs, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in saccade inhibition, prediction and spatial working memory. Saccades may also be used as a convenient model of motricity to study general cognitive processes such as motivation and spatial memory. Thus, it has been shown that the posterior part of the anterior cingulate cortex, called the cingulate eye field, is involved in motivation and the preparation of all intentional saccades, but not in reflexive saccades. Recently, our understanding of the cortical control of spatial memory has noticeably progressed by using the simple visuo-oculomotor model represented by the memory-guide saccade paradigm, in which a single saccade is made to the remembered position of a unique visual item presented a while before. Transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have determined that after a brief stage of spatial integration in the posterior parietal cortex (inferior to 300 ms), short-term spatial memory (i.e., up to 15-20 seconds) is controlled by the DLPFC. Behavioral and lesion studies have shown that medium-term spatial memory (between 15 and 20 seconds and a few minutes) is specifically controlled by the parahippocampal cortex, before long-term memorization (i.e., after a few minutes) in the hippocampal formation. These different but complementary study methods used in humans have thus contributed to a better understanding of both eye movement physiology and general cognitive processes preparing motricity as whole."
4,Evidence of activity-dependent withdrawal of corticospinal projections during human development.,"Objective:To characterize the development of ipsilateral corticospinal projections from birth and compare to 1) development of contralateral projections in the same subjects and 2) ipsilateral corticospinal projections in subjects with unilateral lesions of the corticospinal system acquired perinatally or in adulthood.Method:Transcranial magnetic stimulation excited the motor cortex, and responses were recorded bilaterally in pectoralis major, biceps brachii, and the first dorsal interosseus muscles. Subjects studied included 9 neonates recruited at birth, studied longitudinally for 2 years; 85 healthy subjects aged from birth to adulthood; 10 subjects with hemiplegic cerebral palsy; and 8 with hemiplegia after stroke.Results:In neonates, ipsilateral responses had significantly shorter onsets than contralateral responses but similar thresholds and amplitudes. Thresholds within both pathways increased in the first 3 months. Differential development was present from 3 months so that by 18 months ipsilateral responses were significantly smaller and had significantly higher thresholds and longer onset latencies than contralateral responses. A similar pattern of smaller and later ipsilateral responses was observed after transcranial magnetic stimulation of the intact cortex in subjects with stroke. In contrast, subjects with hemiplegic cerebral palsy had ipsilateral responses with onsets, thresholds and amplitudes similar to those of contralateral responses. Significant branching of contralateral corticospinal axons from the intact motor cortex was excluded by cross-correlation analysis.Conclusions:These data, together with previously published anatomic and radiologic studies, are consistent with activity-dependent corticospinal axonal withdrawal during development and maintenance of increased corticomotoneuronal projections from the intact hemisphere after unilateral perinatal lesions."
5,Differences in sensory and motor cortical organization following brain injury early in life.,"There have been a number of physiological studies of motor recovery in hemiplegic cerebral palsy which have identified the presence of novel ipsilateral projections from the undamaged hemisphere to the affected hand. However, little is known regarding the afferent projection to sensory cortex and its relationship to the reorganized cortical motor output. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate the corticomotor projection to the affected and unaffected hands in a group of subjects with hemiplegic cerebral palsy, and also performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of the patterns of activation in cortical motor and sensory areas following active and passive movement of the hands. Both TMS and fMRI demonstrated a normal contralateral motor and sensory projection between the unaffected hand and the cerebral hemisphere. However, in the case of the affected hand, the TMS results indicated either a purely ipsilateral projection or a bilateral projection in which the ipsilateral pathway had the lower motor threshold, whereas passive movement resulted in fMRI activation in the contralateral hemisphere. These results demonstrate that there is a significant fast-conducting corticomotor projection to the affected hand from the ipsilateral hemisphere in this group of subjects, but that the predominant afferent projection from the hand is still directed to the affected contralateral hemisphere, resulting in an interhemispheric dissociation between afferent kinesthetic inputs and efferent corticomotor output. The findings indicate that there can be differences in the organization of sensory and motor pathways in cerebral palsy, and suggest that some of the residual motor dysfunction experienced by these subjects could be due to an impairment of sensorimotor integration at cortical level as a result of reorganization in the motor system."
6,Cricopharyngeal sphincter muscle responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation in normal subjects and in patients with dysphagia.,"Objective:Cricopharyngeal (CP) muscle of the upper oesophageal sphincter (UES) has a significant role in the pharyngo-esophageal phase of deglutition. The linkage between the CP muscle of UES and the motor cortex has not been previously studied electrophysiologically in healthy humans and in patients with neurogenic dysphagia.Methods:Needle recordings of EMG responses were carried out from the CP sphincter muscle following transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the vertex around the Cz electrode position (cortical MEP), and on the parieto-occipital skull and the occiput ipsilaterally (peripheral MEP) in 14 healthy control subjects and in 26 patients with and without neurogenic dysphagia. Needle recordings obtained from the cricothyroid muscle of the larynx were also evaluated in six healthy subjects.Results:The cortical motor latency of CP sphincter muscle was 10.7+/-0.5 ms with an amplitude of 0.8+/-0.2 mV in healthy subjects. Both the latency and amplitude of CP-MEP were facilitated during swallowing. The peripheral MEP of the CP muscle was very stable in all normal subjects (5.1+/-0.3 ms; 1.3+/-0.3 mV) and swallowing did not influence these parameters. The cortically elicited CP-MEP was significantly longer than the cortical MEPs obtained from the cricothyroid muscle of the larynx. In 10 dysphagic patients with corticobulbar tract involvement (6 ALS and 4 pseudobulbar palsy) and with pathologic and hyperreflexic EMG of the CP-sphincter muscle, the cortical MEP of CP muscle of the upper esophageal sphincter could not be elicited, although the peripheral CP-MEPs were obtained. TMS never produced a swallowing movement in neither healthy subjects nor patients.Conclusion:The CP muscle of the upper esophageal sphincter can produce MEPs by cortical TMS and by stimulation at the root/nerve levels of vagus nerve. The MEP latency values and central motor delay suggest that there is an oligosynaptic corticobulbar pathway to the motoneurons of CP muscles. When the pathway is affected by a pathology (i.e. ALS or pseudobulbar palsy) the CP sphincter becomes hyperreflexic due to disinhibition and the cortical MEP of the CP muscle disappears due to degeneration of the corticobulbar pathway. These mechanisms appear to be responsible for the pathogenesis of dysphagia."
7,Reorganization of the motor cortex in a patient with congenital hemiparesis and mirror movements.,"Abnormal branching of corticospinal fibers from the unaffected motor cortex is responsible for mirror movements in patients with congenital hemiparesis, but it is unknown which mechanisms enable these patients to lateralize motor activity. Using multiunit electromyographic analysis and transcranial magnetic stimulation, the authors provide evidence for nonbranched crossed and uncrossed corticospinal projections and intracortical inhibition of the mirror hand. They propose that this remarkable reorganization of the unaffected motor cortex helps these patients to reduce mirror movements."
8,Facial palsy in cerebral venous thrombosis : transcranial stimulation and pathophysiological considerations.,"Background:Cranial nerve palsy in cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CVT) is rare, its pathophysiology remains unclear, and data from electrophysiological examinations in such patients are missing.Case description:We report the case of a 17-year-old woman with familial protein S deficiency who was admitted with extensive multiple CVT. Two weeks after onset of symptoms, she developed isolated right peripheral facial palsy, and MR venography showed segmental occlusion of the ipsilateral transverse sinus. Complete recovery of facial palsy occurred concomitant with recanalization of the transverse sinus. Facial neurography, including transcranial magnetic stimulation of the facial nerve and related motor cortex, ruled out a coincidental idiopathic palsy and revealed conduction block proximal to the facial canal.Conclusions:Facial palsy in our patient was caused by transient neurapraxia in the intracranial segment of the nerve. We suggest that elevated venous transmural pressure in the nerve's satellite vein, which belongs to the affected drainage territory of the transverse sinus, might have caused venous blood-brain barrier dysfunction in the intrinsic vascular system of the nerve, with leakage of fluids and ions into the endoneurial space and thus an increase in interstitial resistance."
9,Absence of response to early transcranial magnetic stimulation in ischemic stroke patients: prognostic value for hand motor recovery.,"Background and purpose:Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been proposed as a prognostic tool in stroke patients. Most of the previous studies agree in considering the presence of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the first days after a stroke as an indicator of good outcome. In the present study, we have assessed the prognostic value of the absence of response to early TMS on hand motor recovery in stroke patients with complete hand palsy at onset due to ischemia in the area of the middle cerebral artery.Methods:Fifteen patients submitted to TMS within 48 hours of stroke onset (defined as day 1) and again after 1 year. They were also evaluated clinically on day 1 by a scale derived from the Medical Research Council (MRC) and by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) stroke scale; they were reevaluated by the same scales and by Barthel Index on day 365.Results:On day 1, all the patients had complete hand palsy and no response to TMS; their NIH scores showed great variability. After 1 year, 6 of 15 patients regained small and prolonged MEPs, together with a very poor and not functionally useful motor recovery. NIH scores were significantly improved. Barthel Index scores showed large interindividual differences and were not correlated with MRC scores.Conclusions:We conclude that in patients with complete hand palsy, the absence of response to TMS in the first hours is predictive of absent or very poor, not useful, hand motor recovery."
10,[Possible one-dimensional determination of cortical representative fields of mimetic lower lip muscles by transcranial magnetic stimulation].,"Background:Recent reports as well as results from animal studies indicate changes of cortical organization in patients with facial palsy with a decrease in size of the face-associated cortical representation area. With regard to these alterations, there are no detailed reports in the literature about the possibility of a cortical mapping of mimetic muscles by TMS.Method:In 21 healthy volunteers we investigated the amplitude and the onset latency of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the depressor anguli oris and depressor labii inferioris muscles during cortical transcranial magnetic stimulation by use of a figure-8-shaped coil (double 70 mm coil) as a function of the scalp positions stimulated in order to establish a reproducible representation area along the interaural line.Results:Cortical evoked MEPs characterized by onset latencies of 6-30 ms were elicited by contralateral and ipsilateral stimulation from coil positions between 4 and 13 cm lateral to the vertex. Maximal responses (mean amplitude 1.5 +/- 0.8 mV contralateral, 0.8 +/- 0.5 mV ipsilateral) with shortest mean onset latencies (11.5 +/- 1.5 ms contralateral, 12.2 +/- 2.8 ms ipsilatral) were observed at a coil position of 10 cm latral to the vertex.Conclusion:TMS offers a noninvasive method of one dimensional quantification of the cortical representation area of lower lip mimetic muscles."
11,Cortical control of spinal pathways mediating group II excitation to human thigh motoneurones.,"1. The possibility was investigated that cortical excitation to human thigh motoneurones is relayed via lumbar premotoneurones. 2. Test responses were evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in voluntarily contracting quadriceps (Q) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles: either a motor evoked potential (MEP) in surface recordings or a peak of cortical excitation in the post-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) of single motor units was used. These test responses were conditioned by stimuli to the common peroneal (CP) or gastrocnemius medialis (GM) nerves. 3. CP stimulation evoked a large biphasic facilitation of the Q MEP, with early, short-lasting, low-threshold (0.6-0.8 x motor threshold (MT)) and late, longer lasting and higher threshold (1.2-1.5 x MT) peaks separated by a period of depression. GM nerve stimulation evoked a similar early depression and late facilitation in the ST MEP. 4. CP-induced effects in the Q H reflex were different (smaller late facilitation not preceded by any depression), suggesting that CP and cortical volleys interact at a premotoneuronal level to modify the Q MEP. 5. Peaks of cortical excitation evoked by TMS in single motor unit PSTHs were modulated by the conditioning volley like the MEPs with, in Q motor units, early and late CP-induced facilitations separated by a depression, and in ST motor units a late GM-induced facilitation. Facilitations on combined stimulation (i) were greater than the sum of effects by separate stimuli and (ii) never affected the initial part of the cortical peak. 6. It is concluded that the features of the reported facilitatory interactions between cortical and peripheral volleys are consistent with interactions in a population of lumbar excitatory premotoneurones co-activated by group I and group II afferents. The potency of the effects suggests that a significant part of the cortical excitation to motoneurones of thigh muscles is relayed via these interneurones. 7. It is argued that the early depression in ST motoneurones and the separation of the two peaks of facilitation in Q motoneurones reflect a cortical facilitation of spinal inhibitory interneurones projecting on excitatory premotoneurones."
12,Functional recovery in hemiplegic cerebral palsy: ipsilateral electromyographic responses to focal transcranial magnetic stimulation.,"The patterns of functional recovery after unilateral cerebral damage occurring in the prenatal to infantile periods were studied in nine patients with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from the small hand muscles were investigated using focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The MEPs findings could be separated into three subtypes based on the features of ipsilateral MEPs elicited by TMS over the unaffected motor cortex. Bilateral MEPs of similar latency were obtained in three patients. These patients each having a congenital lesion invariably exhibited mirror movements and severe hemiparesis. Meanwhile, ipsilateral MEPs with markedly prolonged latency were demonstrated in two other patients, who exhibited synergistic associated movements and severe hemiparesis caused by an acquired lesion. In the remaining four patients, who showed mild hemiparesis without such abnormal interlimb coordinations, there were no ipsilateral MEPs. Thus, we suggest that TMS is useful for confirming the electrophysiological findings relevant to functional recovery in hemiplegic cerebral palsy underlying such abnormal interlimb coordinations. Specifically, bilateral MEPs of similar latency were considered consistent with compensatory mirror movements originating from bilateral motor representation in the unaffected motor cortex."
13,Central motor reorganization in cerebral palsy patients with bilateral cerebral lesions.,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used to describe cortical plasticity after unilateral cerebral lesions. The objective of this study was to find out whether cortical plasticity occurs after bilateral cerebral lesions. We investigated central motor reorganization for the arm and leg muscles in cerebral palsy (CP) patients with bilateral cerebral lesions using TMS. Seventeen patients (12 with spastic diplegia, 1 with spastic hemiplegia, and 4 with athetoid CP) and 10 normal subjects, were studied. On CT/MRI, bilateral periventricular leukomalacia was observed in all spastic patients with preterm birth. In two normal subjects, motor responses were induced in the ipsilateral tibialis anterior, but no responses were induced in any normal subject in the ipsilateral abductor pollicis brevis (APB) or biceps brachii (BB). Ipsilateral responses were more common among CP patients, especially in TMS of the less damaged hemisphere in patients with marked asymmetries in brain damage: in 3 abductor pollicis brevis, in 6 BBs, and in 15 tibialis anteriors. The cortical mapping of the sites of highest excitability demonstrated that the abductor pollicis brevis and BB sites in CP patients were nearly identical to those of the normal subjects. In patients with spastic CP born prematurely, a significant lateral shift was found for the excitability sites for the tibialis anterior. No similar lateral shift was observed in the other CP patients. These findings suggest that ipsilateral motor pathways are reinforced in both spastic and athetoid CP patients, and that a lateral shift of the motor cortical area for the leg muscle may occur in spastic CP patients with preterm birth."
14,Absence of transcallosal inhibition in adolescents with diplegic cerebral palsy.,"The role of intracortical organization in the pathophysiology of cerebral palsy (CP) is not clear. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation to investigate the paradigm of transcallosal inhibition (TI) in a group of adolescent patients with diplegic CP (n = 4), hereditary spastic paraplegia (n = 2), and healthy control adolescents (n = 4). None of the patients with CP showed TI, whereas all other subjects had normal TI. These findings indicate a lack of inhibitory control of the motor cortex in CP."

16,Ontogeny of ipsilateral corticospinal projections: a developmental study with transcranial magnetic stimulation.,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used to describe the maturation of the corticospinal tract in children. Ipsilateral corticospinal connections have been demonstrated with TMS in patients with congenital mirror movements, in patients after hemispherectomy, and in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. The goal of the study was to find out whether corticospinal ipsilateral projections in children can be demonstrated during the first decade of life as part of normal ontogeny. For this purpose, we examined 50 normal children (age range, 3-11 years) with focal TMS over the left and right hemispheres to target muscles in proximal and distal parts of the upper extremity (first dorsal interosseus, biceps brachii, and brachioradialis). To lower the stimulation threshold, we stimulated under voluntary preinnervation. In two-thirds of the children we elicited ipsilateral motor evoked potentials (MEPs). This occurred more often in proximal than in distal muscles. The latency of the ipsilateral MEPs was about 12 to 14 msec longer than the usual contralateral response. From the age of 10, and in adults, ipsilateral MEPs could not be detected. Also considering lesion data from adult patients, the most likely explanation for the disappearance of ipsilateral corticospinal connections after the age of 10 years is an increasing transcallosal inhibitory influence during development. The presence of ipsilateral corticospinal connections appears to be a normal state in ontogeny."
17,Nuclear facial palsy in multiple sclerosis: a case report.,"We encountered an unusual case of isolated subacute nuclear palsy of the facial nerve in a 31-year-old man with a 3-year history of clinically established relapsing form of multiple sclerosis. Typical positive sharp waves and fibrillation potentials in the affected facial muscles detected by means of electromyography showed that the lesion was located in the lower motor neuron. Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the cortex could not evoke normal compound motor unit potentials, however, transcranial magnetic stimulation of the facial nerve, which is strongly supposed to depolarize the peripheral nerve in the area of the root exit zone near the internal acoustic meatus, elicited an adequate response. Taking these findings as well as the results of positive magnetic resonance imaging into consideration, we concluded that the clinical symptom was due to a plaque of demyelinization in the nucleus of the facial nerve or in the proximal intramedullary course of facial fibres."
18,Cortical reorganization in patients with facial palsy.,"Possible changes in the organization of the cortex in patients with facial palsy, serving as a model of peripheral motor deefferentation, were investigated by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and positron emission tomography (PET). With TMS, the size of the area producing muscle-evoked potentials (MEPs) of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle, the sum of MEP amplitudes within this area, and the volume over the mapping area were compared between both hemispheres in 8 patients. With PET, increases in regional cerebral blood flow, measured with the standard H2(15)O2 bolus injection technique, were compared between 6 patients and 6 healthy volunteers during sequential finger opposition. Patients moved the hand ipsilateral to the facial palsy, the control subjects the right hand. Of 9 patients in total, 5 participated in both experiments. With both methods, an enlargement of the hand field contralateral to the facial palsy was found, extending in a lateral direction, into the site of the presumed face area. The PET data showed that the enlargement of the hand field in the somatosensory cortex (SMC) is part of a widespread cortical reorganization, including the ipsilateral SMC and bilateral secondary motor and sensory areas. We report for the first time, using two different noninvasive methods, that peripheral, mere motor deefferentation is a sufficient stimulus for reorganizational changes in the healthy adult human cortex."
19,Facilitation of ipsilateral motor pathways during recovery from hemiplegia in two adolescent patients.,"In two hemiplegic patients with acquired cerebral lesions, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was carried out to examine the contribution of the ipsilateral motor pathways to recovery from hemiplegia. A 13-year-old girl (patient 1) had acute hemiplegia due to a rupture of an arteriovenous malformation, and a 13-year-old boy (patient 2) had subacute hemiplegia due to a brain tumour. They showed complete upper limb palsy but recovered after therapy; patient 1 had slightly disabled motor function of the arm, and patient 2 recovered completely. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the biceps brachii muscles on both sides. The MEPs of the paretic biceps were only elicited by TMS of the intact hemisphere at the beginning of recovery from hemiplegia, but not by TMS of the affected hemisphere. The MEP amplitudes increased and cortical representation areas for the paretic biceps by TMS were enlarged temporarily during recovery. They regressed in patient 1 and MEPs were not evoked at all in patient 2 after recovery. Conversely, MEPs were obtained by TMS of the affected hemisphere after recovery in both patients. These data indicate that ipsilateral motor pathways play a role in recovery from hemiplegia, especially at the beginning, and become inactivated when the contralateral motor pathways recover."
20,Can motor recovery in stroke patients be predicted by early transcranial magnetic stimulation?,"Background and purpose:We used transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex to evaluate the functional state of corticospinal pathways innervating the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the hand in 26 patients suffering from a first-ever ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory.Methods:All patients had complete hand palsy and were tested within the first 24 hours from stroke onset. Patients were also tested clinically with the MRC, Rankin, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) stroke scales at day 1 and with MRC and NIH scales and the Barthel Index at day 14. Electrophysiological testing was repeated at day 14. Patients were divided into three subgroups according to the amplitude of the maximal response (motor evoked potential [MEP]) evoked at day 1.Results:After 2 weeks, all 6 patients with initial MEPs > 5% maximum motor response (Mmax) showed some first dorsal interosseous muscle motor function recovery, whereas 19 of 20 patients with initially absent or small (< 5% Mmax) MEPs were left with complete hand palsy. There were strong positive correlations between MEP amplitude at day 1 and MRC and Barthel Index scores at day 14. However, measurement of central motor conduction time proved to be of little prognostic value.Conclusions:We conclude that early-performed transcranial magnetic stimulation is a valuable prognostic tool for motor recovery from stroke and that relatively preserved MEP amplitude shortly after stroke is a better prognostic factor than normal central motor conduction time."
21,[Motor evoked potentials of transcranial magnetic stimulation for Parkinson's disease].,"We studied motor evoked potential (MEP) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 37 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). TMS was used at high energy capacity (800 Volts) in all patients and normal subjects under resting position. MEPs were recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis and the abductor hallucis. Magnetic stimulator equipped with an 8-shaped coil and a flat type coil was used for TMS. The data were statistically evaluated using a paired Student t test. The latency of MEPs were slightly shorter in PD patients than that in normal subjects. There were significant differences between HV. (Healthy volunteers) and group B (Hoehn & Yahr's stage III) (p = 0.012), HV, and group C (Hoehn & Yahr's stage IV.V) (p = 0.002), group A (Hoehn & Yahr's stage I.II) and C (p = 0.005) respectively. The duration of MEPs became longer depending on the severity of PD evaluated by Hoehn & Yahr's disability rating. Significant correlations were found between HV, and group C (p = 0.001), group A and C (p = 0.015). The amplitude of MEPs also increased with the severity on the rating. There were significant differences between HV, and group C (p = 0.0002), group A and B (p = 0.0004), group B and C (p = 0.0009) respectively. These changes of MEP findings indicated the dysfunction of pyramidal motor pathways in PD. Thus, the disability in patients with PD can be well evaluated by MEP measurement."
22,Corticospinal input onto motor neurons projecting to ankle muscles in individuals with cerebral palsy.,"Cross-correlograms between voluntarily active soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior (TA) motor units were generated from seven control subjects and six subjects with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Short-duration central peaks were observed in three subjects with spastic diplegia only. All subjects demonstrated reciprocal inhibition in TA following electrical stimulation of group I afferents to SOL, and all subjects with CP demonstrated strong activation of both TA and SOL in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation. Responses in SOL were stronger than those observed from controls. These data support the existence of abnormal corticospinal projections to soleus motor neurons in individuals with spastic CP. In spastic diplegia, short-term discharge synchrony between SOL and TA motor units may reflect abnormal interneuronal modulation at the spinal level. Abnormal corticospinal projections and/or modulation of spinal interneurons may contribute to the disordered movement patterns and co-activation observed in this population."
23,Transcranial magnetic stimulation as a diagnostic and prognostic test in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Corticospinal stimulus conduction was investigated after transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex in 63 patients (20 female, 43 male, 59 +/- 12 years) with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and progressive bulbar palsy. Recordings were made bilaterally from the Abductor digiti minimi muscle (ADM) in the hand and the Tibialis anterior muscle (TA) in the leg. Thirteen patients were re-examined after 250 +/- 125 days. Eight patients were examined a third time after 552 +/- 165 days. At the first investigation central motor conduction time was abnormal to one or more target muscles in 51% (n = 32) of all patients. No significant delay in CMCT developed during follow-up. The average time of survival of patients with normal CMCT at the first investigation was 16.5 +/- 7.5 months, and 14.7 +/- 8.8 months in patients with abnormal CMCT. This is not a significant difference. It is therefore concluded that transcranial magnetic stimulation is not a sensitive tool in the diagnosis of ALS. Furthermore, CMCT does not provide significant prognostic information."
24,Transcranial magnetic coil stimulation of motor cortex in patients with central pain.,"We report two patients with deafferentation pain secondary to central nervous system lesions who were evaluated by noninvasive magnetic coil stimulation of the motor cortex followed by electrical motor cortex stimulation with epidural electrode array implantation. Magnetic coil stimulation was very useful to estimate the effect of electrical stimulation. Our first patient was a 52-year-old man who experienced a left putamenal hemorrhage at the age of 48. Two years later, he had paresthesias and intractable pain in the extremities and face on the right side. Pain was resistant to barbiturates but responded to magnetic coil stimulation of the motor cortex. Electrical motor cortex stimulation provided excellent relief from the pain. The second patient was a 43-year-old man who was suffering from congenital cerebral palsy for which left thalamotomy was performed two times, at the ages of 9 and 13. He began to experience intractable pain on the right side 20 years later. Although barbiturate administration was effective for pain relief, neither magnetic coil stimulation nor electrical stimulation of the motor cortex gave relief from pain."
25,Altered corticospinal projections to lower limb motoneurons in subjects with cerebral palsy.,"The projections of cortical neurons activated by transcranial magnetic stimulation to the motoneurons of lower limb muscles were examined in 22 normal subjects and 14 subjects with cerebral palsy (CP). In normal subjects, magnetic stimulation produced strong facilitation of tibialis anterior (TA) motoneurons, but little or no facilitation of soleus (SOL) motoneurons. This differential facilitation of TA and SOL motoneurons was observed at all stimulus sites on the scalp and all stimulus intensities at which responses could be elicited. In subjects with CP, magnetic stimulation produced almost equal facilitation of TA and SOL motoneurons. This could not be explained by differences in the excitability of the respective motoneuron pools. It is postulated that the projections from the motor cortex to spinal motoneurons are altered in CP. These abnormal projections may contribute to the impairment of voluntary movements experienced by these subjects."
26,Estimation of facial central motor delay by electrical stimulation of the motor cortex of the dog.,"Central delay time (CD) has been estimated for activation of limb muscles by electrical or transcranial magnetic coil (TMC) stimulation of motor cortex and ventral root outflow. In the present study, we used surface electrical stimulation of the motor cortex of the right hemisphere to produce evoked compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) from the contralateral orbicularis oris (o.r.), and orbicularis oculi (o.c.), in dogs. Monopolar electrical stimulation of the facial nerve at the cerebello-pontine (CP) angle yielded CMAP activation of ipsilateral facial muscles. These latencies when subtracted from those obtained by direct cortical stimulation established CD for activation of the seventh cranial nerve. Preliminary data with single pulse magnetic stimulation at high outputs (greater than 80%) revealed CMAP with onset latencies similar to the direct facial nerve stimulation at the CP angle by electrical means."
27,[Assessment of motor cranial nerve functions using transcranial magnetic stimulation].,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation applied over one cerebral hemisphere evokes bilateral responses in the muscles supplied by cranial nerves (masseter, mentalis, sternomastoid, genioglossus) (Tabl. 1). The relatively long latencies of these responses and the influence that preactivation of the muscle has on them, suggests that they are cortically evoked. Shorter latency and exclusively ipsilateral responses can be obtained if the position of the stimulating coil over the head is more lateral. These responses are uninfluenced by pre-activation of the muscle which suggests that they arise from stimulation of the peripheral nerve itself. By considering the conduction velocity of the nerve and the response latency such stimulation probably occurs in the proximal intracisternal segment (Fig. 2). The results obtained using magnetic stimulation of the cortex in patients with unilateral cerebral hemisphere lesions lend support to the idea of a bilateral projection from each cerebral hemisphere to the motor nuclei of the facial and hypoglossal nerves on both sides: stimulations over the intact hemisphere produces bilateral responses, whereas stimulations over the damaged hemisphere produce no responses (Fig. 1). In patients with idiopathic facial palsy no short latency responses were obtained on the affected side either during the acute (less than 10 days) or during the chronic phase (greater than 3 months) of the illness-despite clinical improvement during the chronic stage (Fig. 3, 4). However cortically evoked responses were obtainable in patients seen during the chronic phase indicating that facial motoneurones could be excited transsynaptically (Fig. 3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
